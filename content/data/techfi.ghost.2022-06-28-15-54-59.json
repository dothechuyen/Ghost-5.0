We may, for example, see and follow blockchain data analytics and\nengage with this data source directly. We can also use SQL to query data, create\na chart, and construct our own dashboard.\n\nSo, what exactly is Dune? What were the goals behind its creation? What is the\nmechanism behind it? What method does it use to arrange data? This article will\nanswer these questions and provide readers with profound insight into Dune\nAnalytics. Moreover, there is also a little tutorial on building a simple\ndashboard and sharing it with others\n\nWhat is Dune Analytics?\n\"Dune Analytics,\" according to Dune Analytics' definition, is a strong tool for\nblockchain research. Dune provides users with all the tools they need to query,\nextract, and display massive volumes of blockchain data. Dune is democratizing\npublic blockchain data by making it available to anyone.\"\n\nDespite that the data in the blockchain is public and accessible, not everyone\ncan use it, given that the collection and processing of this data source are\ncomplicated. To interact with blocks we want to exact, we have to run scripts\nand use accompanying services (e.g., archive node or full node,v.v.). This\nprocess is both time-consuming and challenging to reuse.\n\nDune Analytics solves that problem by allowing users to access and use\nblockchain data more efficiently. It is a web-based platform for querying\nblockchain data saved in a pre-populated database. Instead of writing complex\nscripts, we only need to use simple SQL queries to get data. In addition, Dune\nprovides valuable tools to process, calculate and visualize this data. With\nDune, we can create our own dashboards and scientifically organize graphic\ncharts and tables.\n\nHow Dune works\nDune converts difficult-to-access data into human-readable tables. This platform\naggregates blockchain data and saves them in SQL databases. By that, we can use\nSQL queries to access data easily and then visualize data with methods provided\nby Dune. Finally, Dune helps us organize our analysis charts and tables as well\nas create a customized dashboard. This magical platform is a little social media\nsite where we may promote our dashboards and also follow others.\n\nEach dashboard is categorized by the reason for which it was designed. In Dune,\nthere are three different sorts of dashboards:\n\n * Project dashboard\n * Sector dashboard\n * Ecosystem dashboard\n\nData in Dune Analytics\nData of Dune Analytics is organized in SQL tables and saved in PostgreSQL\ndatabases. The data schema is described as follows [2]:\n\n * Low-level data (raw transaction data) provides detailed records of all\n   activities on the blockchain.\n * Decoded Data tables use the Application binary interface of the respective\n   smart contract to turn the encoded data into decoded data.\n * Abstractions are higher-level created tables that return\n   aggregated/standardized data on sectors/topics.\n\nIn fact, the data is not real-time but is continuously updated with the latest 5\nor 6 hours from the current time.\n\nWe can get how to find the desired data in the link below:\n\nhttps://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables#how-do-i-find-the-data-i-need\n\nThe detailed structure and information of SQL tables:\n\n * nft.trade\n   [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/nft.trading#ser-my-platform-is-not-indexed]\n   : an effort to make NFT trading data readily available to everyone.\n * Raw data types: Ethereum data\n   [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/raw-data/ethereum-data], xDai\n   data [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/raw-data/xdai-data], \n   Solana Data\n   [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/raw-data/solana-data#solana.blocks]\n   .\n * Decoded data [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/decoded-data]:\n   Dunes decodes smart contract activity into human-readable tables.\n * Token standards\n   [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/special-tables#interfaces]:\n   These tables make it easy to keep track of ERC20 tokens and the status of\n   NFTs, which flow in and out of contracts and wallets. They are widely used\n   across the dune.\n * ERC-20 balance\n   [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/erc-20-balances]: The tables\n   allow for easy tracking, wallet balances, token allocations, and token supply\n   over time or in a snapshot format.\n * Abstractions [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/abstractions]:\n   the custom tables that team Dune and their community maintain.\n * User Generated [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/user-generated]\n   : users' data tables.\n * Prices [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/prices]: The Price is\n   the volume-weighted price based on real-time market data, translated to USD.\n   This table supports a range of erc20.tokens.\n * Labels [https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables/labels]: Address labels\n   are a Dune feature where users can add, update, and query labels for any\n   address.\n\nElements in a Dune App\nThere are four main features in Dune App, including query, visualizations,\ndashboards, adding new contract:\n\n * Query: Dune provides a query editor where users can query their data.\n * Visualizations: Query results are visualized to effectively communicate\n   users' findings to their audience.\n * Dashboards: A layout page to present all visualizations.\n * Adding a new contract.\n\nCreate a simple Dune App\nFollow these steps to create your Dune App:\n\nFolk query\nFirstly, create your query by fork query from someone else or write it yourself.\nThen, you can search the dashboard or query on the homepage with content you are\ninterested in.\n\n\nFigure 1. DUNE home pageAfter choosing a dashboard, you will see all\nvisualizations of that dashboard. If you select a query, the query editor will\nappear, and you can fork it.\n\nFigure 2. The example dashboardIn the next step, once clicking on the\nvisualization, you will see a query of that visualization, which you can fork\nand save to your query.\n\nFigure 3. Fork queryWrite a new query\nDune app provides a query editor that allows you to query data and share it with\neveryone\n\n\nFigure 4. Query editorCreate a dashboard\nAfter building a query and visualizing query results, you can create a new\ndashboard. In this dashboard, you are able to add query results and\nvisualizations in your collection or others. You can also design a layout for\nyour dashboard.\n\nConclusion\nDune allows us to develop our view about blockchain data,  share it with\neveryone, and see other people's perspectives. This platform has a massive\nquantity of data, including some that we can not discover anywhere else.\nNonetheless, Dune is not perfect. We found some defects in it, such as being\nhard to use for people with no experience with SQL or coding, not allowing chart\nediting, or Poor user interface design [3]. (According to \"Dune Analytics Review\nand Best Alternatives.”). Thus, it still has a long way to go and develop in the\nnear future.\n\nReference\n[1] “Introduction to Dune Analytics.” Introduction to Dune Analytics,\n[https://docs.dune.xyz/#introduction] Accessed 2 March 2022.\n\n[2] “Data tables.” Dune Analytics\n[https://docs.dune.xyz/data-tables/data-tables], Accessed 2 March 2022.\n\n[3] “Dune Analytics Review and Best Alternatives.” Crypto Listy, 3 November 2021\n[https://cryptolisty.com/analysis-tools/dune-analytics-review-and-best-alternatives/.]\n, Accessed 2 March 2022.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/03/Dune-Analytics---Powerful-Tool-For-Blockchain-Research.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dd5","created_at":"2022-03-25 06:48:39","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-01 04:59:38","updated_by":null,"published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e2d","uuid":"2782499e-3380-4558-a1cd-6594a282e657","title":"API3 - First-Party Oracle Solution for Oracle Problem","slug":"api3-first-party-oracle-solution-for-oracle-problem","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MLk7wojbxcAw87Q9SO14q3KlZ_hUWw-XhD4L0pSr-6pXnPmUS7s7fLEJFdqs0byh5psCNZNrsRg3baioroCGXzT6ANSiprXNinxZu0_1Rd0XLBMxFXx-hGI8YMqFFllFjrPfPuIR\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"The architecture of Blockchain Oracle\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gh_Qyscv8PxlcN5gz0RqBWHRP_SnMbVGTlrJvZJAhbUdzdWiQNy0QHqGUmMBIHDXAYLC0GMlLyefGKxohV-gi9HNod4FK6fqGYa_mNsD78SAKTOYVjpdU1IsLyaA68BL-vsliKuQ\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Third-party oracle solution\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/sQSVB9_BGg0L5llRZonV_ubwiWex_B-d1JxkNN6Xi0MXCS1YayMJCMgXXTzEhCX7CvFZS42ZGRRqLSJS4Tk6usAcDvHsTgOf9A5hgS0ZTbzmb3_F-RwvDs7Yb_hpwPx0V0kWzNEr\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"cardWidth\":\"\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"| **First-party oracle model** | **Third-party oracle model** | \\n|-----|-| \\n| Involve the API provider who owns the data source | Ignore the original source of data |\\n| API providers themselves operate oracle | Oracle is operated by any individual or group who gets information from API providers |\\n| Data is put directly in the blockchain by API providers | Data get from off-chain unknown source by third-party oracle |\\n| Data is aggregated securely and transparently on a trustless blockchain | Need to trust the third-party oracle |\\n| Decentralized governance | Governed by a centralized entity |\"}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<table style=\\\"border-collapse: collapse;

The solution\nAPI3 introduces is Decentralized API (or dAPI for short) - a network of\nfirst-party oracles that provide traditional API services in a decentralized and\nblockchain-native manner.\n\nSo, what is dAPI? What is a first-party oracle? And why some media referred to\nAPI3 as a “Chainlink killer”. The article will explain in-depth all need-to-know\nthings about API3.\n\nWhat problems does API3 solve?\nThe API connectivity problem\nThe isolation of blockchain from the real world makes it a powerful technology\nwith high security and assurance; however, it limits the potential of smart\ncontracts.\n\nSince smart contracts are built on the blockchain, they are unable to use web\nAPIs to access off-chain data in the same way that common web applications can.\nThey can only operate on the available data on the blockchain (on-chain data).\nIn addition, smart contracts are completely walled-off from off-chain data such\nas real-world data (weather, temperature, etc.) or crypto market data.\n\nIf smart contracts can connect to the off-chain data, it can help DeFi\napplications make important decisions and allow them to provide meaningful\nservices such as market prediction, swap, or lending, …\n\nThe oracle problem\nBlockchain oracle is introduced to solve the API connectivity problem.\n\nThe architecture of Blockchain OracleOracle is a bridge between blockchains and\noutside API, which provides smart contracts on the blockchain with real-time\naccess to off-chain data.\n\nData sources (from API providers), oracles, and on-chain data consumers (such as\nsmart contracts of a dApp) are the three parties of an oracle problem. However,\nto tackle the oracle problem, the existing solutions are modeling their\necosystem as solely composed of oracles and data consumers, ignoring the data\nsource.\n\nThe problems with third-party oracles as middlemen\nThe oracles in the above architecture are known as “third-party oracles”-\nmultiple oracles that get information from any unknown data source and then\ntransmit them onto an on-chain aggregator to aggregate the oracle reports into a\nsingle data feed.\n\nChainlink is a good example of this third-party oracle solution.\n\nThird-party oracle solutionHowever, the solution with a third-party oracle as a\nmiddleman has its own drawbacks:\n\n * Middleman tax: Some oracles might deliver misreports to smart contracts for\n   financial motives. Therefore, you have to pay them a great amount of money,\n   known as “middleman tax”, to incentivize these oracles to report honestly.\n * Ineffective architecture: Many oracles in the oracle network probably get the\n   information from the same source. As a result, it adds redundancy,\n   operational costs, and security risks rather than data decentralization.\n * Lack of transparency: Third-party oracles do not honestly reveal where their\n   data originates from.\n * Vulnerability: A group of oracles can collude to tamper the data for their\n   financial motives.\n\nSolution from API3\ndAPI with first-party oracle\nThe architecture that API3 proposes is decentralized API(dAPI)\n\ndAPI is the network of first-party oracles (oracles operated directly by API\nproviders) that provide traditional API services in a decentralized and\nblockchain-native manner. In this architecture, API providers put their raw data\ndirectly on the blockchain in the first place, allowing the data feed to be\ncreated on-chain and become more transparent. dAPI is also a multi-layer,\ncross-platform data solution that can be connectable to any blockchain to\nprovide smart contracts running on them with trusted off-chain data.\n\nUnlike third-party oracle architecture, API3 data feeds are governed by a\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization-API3 DAO. This allows dAPIs to be operated\nwith maximal transparency and trusted-minimized way.\n\nWe can see the main difference between first party-oracle and third-party oracle\nmodel:\n\nFirst-party oracle modelThird-party oracle modelInvolve the API provider who\nowns the data sourceIgnore the original source of dataAPI providers themselves\noperate oracleOracle is operated by any individual or group who gets information\nfrom API providersData is put directly in the blockchain by API providersData\nget from off-chain unknown source by third-party oracleData is aggregated\nsecurely and transparently on a trustless blockchainNeed to trust the\nthird-party oracleDecentralized governanceGoverned by a centralized entity\nFirst-party oracle modelThird-party oracle modelInvolve the API provider who\nowns the data sourceIgnore the original source of dataAPI providers themselves\noperate oracleOracle is operated by any individual or group who gets information\nfrom API providersData is put directly in the blockchain by API providersData\nget from off-chain unknown source by third-party oracleData is aggregated\nsecurely and transparently on a trustless blockchainNeed to trust the\nthird-party oracleDecentralized governanceGoverned by a centralized entity\nAirnode\nAPI providers have difficulty operating their oracle nodes because they are\nunfamiliar with blockchain technology and don’t want to deal with\ncryptocurrency.\n\nAPI3 introduces “Airnode” as a solution for this problem.\n\nAirnode is a fully-serverless oracle node that is designed specifically for API\nproviders to operate their oracles.

And with several upcoming\nimprovements and additions, such as the launch of The Graph Council - the\non-chain governance of the platform, it must be said that the analogy between\nThe Graph and Google is not unfounded, and The Graph will play a crucial role in\nthe process of realizing and popularizing Web3 in the near future.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] \"Introduction to The Graph\" [\nhttps://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/introduction/], accessed 2 March 2022.\n\n[2] \"The Graph network in-depth part I\"\n[https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-network-in-depth-part-1], accessed 2 March\n2022. \n\n[3] \"The graph network in-depth part II\"\n[https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-network-in-depth-part-2], accessed 2 March\n2022. \n\n[4] \"The Graph will power the decentralized web\n[https://medium.com/graphprotocol/graphql-will-power-the-decentralized-web-d7443a69c69a]\n\", Brandon Ramirez, accessed 2 March 2022.\n\n[5] \"GraphQL vs. REST: What You Didn’t Know\"\n[https://www.mobilelive.ca/blog/graphql-vs-rest-what-you-didnt-know/], Adil\nSikandar, accessed 3 March 2022. \n\n[6] The Graph Academy, [https://thegraph.academy/indexers/revenue-streams/] \naccessed 3 March 2022.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/The-Graph-Protocol---Google-of-Blockchain.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dcb","created_at":"2022-03-25 07:44:23","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 07:11:13","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-03-25 15:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e2f","uuid":"2277545b-f563-444d-a794-c15138a8d37d","title":"How to Create and Use Subgraphs in a Project?","slug":"how-to-create-and-use-subgraphs-in-a-project","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"code\",{\"code\":\"// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\\npragma solidity >=0.8.0;\\ncontract RandomAssignment{\\n    mapping(address => uint) public valueOf;\\n    event Assign(address indexed addr, uint indexed value);\\n    function assignValueFor(address addr) public {\\n        uint val = block.timestamp%15 + 1;\\n        valueOf[addr] = val;\\n        emit Assign(addr, val);\\n    }\\n}\",\"language\":\"solidity\"}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In this contract we can set any address to a random value from 1 to 15, we can also change the value of the assigned address.

More complicated, we want to get a set of\naddresses assigned with current value from 5 to 10 counting from the second\naddress from block 10228285 forward sorted in ascending order of value. We also\nwant to get data on how many addresses each value is assigned.\n\nWe can do it by Web3 normally, but here we will use The Graph Protocol to create\nopen APIs allowing us to query all information much easier and faster in\nreal-time.\n\nFor simplicity, we deploy this contract on the Rinkeby test net. You can use\nMetaMask as your wallet and get some ETH on Rinkeby through Rinkeby Faucet\n[https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com/]. You can use Remix to deploy this contract for\nsimplicity, please switch to injected Web3 to connect with your MetaMask in the\nRinkeby test net. \n\nHere I deployed it at the address: 0x261eceB52b36D931f3Ec3742a6b66Deb720d8Fe4 \nand then I assigned some random values to some addresses using this contract\n(You can use this address for testing).\n\nCreate decentralized subgraph by Subgraph Studio\nFirst, go to My Subgraphs | Subgraph Studio (thegraph.com)\n[https://thegraph.com/studio/] Connect your wallet -> Sign message to Log in to\nStudio -> Create Subgraph:\n\n-> Set subgraph’s name -> Hit “Continue”\n\nHere if you don’t have NodeJS installed, you need to install it first.\n\n-> Open folder project: npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli to install\ngraph-cli\n\n-> “graph init –studio <subgraph’s name>” to init project.\n\nNote that the subgraph’s name must be the name in Subgraph Studio in lower case.\nIn my case, it must be: \n\ngraph init --studio subgraphforrandomassignment\n\n-> Then we set some information such as network Rinkeby, contract address\nspecific above,...\n\nNote that if you haven’t published your code on Etherscan, you must provide the\nABI file. Here I copy ABI when compiling the contract on Remix and paste it to\nthe file abi.json\n\nThe graph-cli will create a sample subgraph project for your contract. To create\na subgraph, you need to modify 3 files: subgraph.yaml, schema.graphql and\nsrc/mapping.ts\n\n-> cd subgraphforrandomassignment to forward to subgraph folder\n\n-> npm install to install package graph-ts already defined in our package.json\nfile\n\nWe need this library to the write Typescript file\n\n-> In the file schema.graphql, we define each entity(schema) of data that we\nwant to get in our DApp:\n\ntype AddressValue @entity {\n  id: ID!\n  count: Int!\n}\ntype Address @entity {\n  id: ID!\n  timesChange: Int!\n  blockNumber: BigInt!\n  timestamp: BigInt!\n  currentValue: BigInt!\n}\n\nWe need to define 2 entities: Address and AddressValue. We want to get how many\naddresses each value is assigned, so it is the field “count” in “AddressValue”.\nIn “Address”, we want to count how many times the address has been assigned a\nvalue(timeChanged), currentValue, blockNumber, and timestamp. The field “id”\nwith the type “ID!” is unique and required in every entity.\n\n-> In file subgraph.yaml, we write configuration for the subgraph like the\nentities, startBlock, event to catch:\n\n    source:\n      address: \"0x261eceB52b36D931f3Ec3742a6b66Deb720d8Fe4\"\n      abi: RandomAssignment\n      startBlock: 10263362\n\nHere we define the startBlock as the number of the block that the data source\nstarts indexing from. In most cases, we suggest using the block in which the\ncontract was created, if not then the indexer will start from the genesis block.\n\nentities:\n        - AddressValue\n        - Address\n\n\nThese two entities are those we defined in the file schema.graphql before\n\n   eventHandlers:\n        - event: Assign(indexed address,indexed uint256)\n          handler: handleAssign\n\nIt means when the event “Assign” is emitted from the smart contract, it will\nupdate data by calling the function “handleAssign” that we will define in\nmapping.ts\n\nNumerous contracts avoid emitting events so that gas costs can be reduced. In\nthese instances, events are not an effective way to collect relevant changes to\nthe state of a contract. The Graph also uses callHandler and blockHandler to\ncatch new blocks and all function calls or interact with IPFS. \n\n-> graph codegen\n\nTo make smart contracts, events, and entities easy and type-safe, the Graph CLI\ngenerates AssemblyScript types from a combination of the subgraph's GraphQL\nschema and the contract ABIs included in the data sources. This command creates\na new folder generated containing AssemblyScript.\n\n-> The main part is the mapping.ts file which we determine how the data is\nobtained from the blockchain:\n\nimport { Assign as AssignEvent } from \"../generated/RandomAssignment/RandomAssignment\"\nimport { AddressValue, Address } from \"../generated/schema\";\n\nWe need to import all entities defined in schema.graphql to get data for them in\nthis file. The Graph will run from the startBlock to the newest block, catch all\nevents chronologically and handle it via the corresponding handler function in\nmapping.ts\n\nexport function handleAssign(event: AssignEvent): void {\n  let val = AddressValue.load(event.params.value.toString());\n  if(!val){\n    val = new AddressValue(event.params.value.toString());\n    val.count = 0;\n  }\n  let address = Address.load(event.params.addr.toHexString());\n  if(!address){\n    val.count++;\n    address = new Address(event.params.addr.toHexString());\n    address.timesChange = 0;\n  }\n  address.blockNumber = event.block.number;\n  address.timesChange++;\n  address.timestamp = event.block.timestamp;\n  address.currentValue = event.params.value;\n  address.save();\n  val.save();\n}","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/03/photo_2022-03-24_13-58-28.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dcc","created_at":"2022-03-25 08:23:08","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-03-25 11:11:48","updated_by":null,"published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e30","uuid":"37453f12-85c3-442b-b94f-7da4398f95a1","title":"Bitcoin and Ethereum: What's the Difference?","slug":"bitcoin-and-ethereum-whats-the-difference","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xI7_XdGZKMMHOgrUo56UG0AW24jFQ-CgRICq3Hq9VoMhwV8RazBUCDiCll3HHGP-3FUPjNuUHNDArx62a86ILazCq9LziFTGGKSCS_YlelSo02vzTbqhyOjs0kjSA0-QfkyaGgFJ\",\"alt\":\"Block Chain overview\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"<em>Source: Tek4.vn</em>\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\" https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/index.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\" https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h2\",[[0,[0],1,\"The introduction to Bitcoin\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created in 2009 by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.

While Bitcoin is focused on cryptocurrencies, Ethereum -\nA byproduct of Blockchain, goes a step further by providing a virtual machine\nand smart contracts that enable users to deploy their tokens, similar to\nBitcoin.\n\nA token can represent a virtual currency, voting, a lottery ticket, or a\ncharacter's skill in a game. There will be a suitable type of token on the\nEthereum network, depending on business logic. Up to now, many types of token\nstandards have been deployed. One of the most popular token standards is ERC-20.\nThis document will explain what the ERC-20 standard is and focus on how to use\nit to deploy a token on the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat is the ERC token standard?\nEthereum's network, launched in 2015, created a lot of attention in the\ndeveloper community and sprouted a lot of tokens on the network. However, there\nweren't any templates or guidelines for token development initially. That\nresulted in a variety of tokens quite different from each other and has made it\ndifficult to program, communicate and exchange tokens. For that reason, the\ncommunity has set the world standard in token creation. These standards came to\nbe known as Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards. ERCs aim to establish\nconventions that make it easier for applications and contracts to interact with\neach other. \n\nWhat is the ERC-20 standard?\n“The ERC-20 introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens. In other words, they have\na property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) of\nanother Token.” [1]\n\nERC-20 token standard requires to include six mandatory functions:\n\n * totalSupply: A method that returns the total supply of your tokens that\n   currently exist. When this limit is reached, the smart contract will refuse\n   to create new tokens.\n * balanceOf: A method that returns the number of tokens a wallet address has.\n * transfer: A method that transfers the number of tokens from the total supply\n   to a wallet.\n * transferFrom: A method that transfers the number of tokens between wallets.\n * approve: Given a recipient address and amount authorizes that address to\n   execute several transfers up to that amount from the account that issued the\n   approval.\n * allowance: Given an owner address and a spender address, returns the\n   remaining amount that the spender is approved to withdraw from the owner.\n\nAnd three optional ones:\n\n * name: Human-readable name of the Token.\n * symbol: Human-readable symbol of your Token.\n * decimals: How dividable your Token is. For example, if decimals are 2, then\n   the token amount is divided by 100 to get its user representation.\n\nDeploy an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network\nPreparation\n 1. In this tutorial, we use:\n\n * Ubuntu 18.04 OS\n * NodeJS v16.14.0 and NPM v8.3.1\n * Truffle v5.3.11\n * MetaMask Extension on Chrome\n\n2. Installation\n\nIf your computer does not have NodeJS installed, you can download them from this \nlink [https://nodejs.org/en/download/] or run the below commands from your\nTerminal.\n\n$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash\n\nThe script will add the NodeSource signing key to your system, create an apt\nrepository file, install all necessary packages, and refresh the apt - cache.\n\nOnce the NodeSource repository is enabled, install Node.js and npm:\n\n$ sudo apt install nodejs\n\nThe nodes package contains both the Node and NPM binaries.\n\nVerify that the Node.js and NPM were successfully installed by printing their\nversions:\n\n$ node --version\n\nOutput\nv16.14.0 \n\n$ npm --version\n\nOutput\nv8.3.1\n\n\nTo be able to compile native addons from npm, you’ll need to install the\ndevelopment tools:\n\n $ sudo apt install build-essential\n\nAfter your computer has installed NPM, you can install Truffle. This is a\ndevelopment environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains\nusing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We’ll use Truffle to compile and\ndeploy smart contract scripts. Execute the below command to install Truffle:\n\n $ npm install -g truffle@5.3.11\n\n $ npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider@1.4.0\n\nVerify that Truffle was successfully installed by printing their versions:\n\n$ truffle --version\n\nOutput\nTruffle v5.3.11 - a development framework for Ethereum\n\n3.

Each node both provides and uses at the same time the network services that promote participation in the network. A strong example of P2P network architecture is the internet in the early days, where nodes on the IP network were equal. Despite the change in its hierarchical architecture, the Internet protocol still retains its flat topology as it was on the first day. In conclusion, P2P networks are robust, decentralized, and open by nature.\"],[1,[],0,0]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"P2P network architecture is no more than a topology choice of the bitcoin network since it has become a vital core characteristic in network consensus to make the power of bitcoin.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"\\\"Bitcoin network\\\" is typical of P2P networks.

SPV nodes download the block headers and not the transactions contained inside each block. Without transactions, the resultant chain of blocks is 1,000 times smaller than the whole blockchain. Because they are unaware of all transactions on the network, SPV nodes cannot build a complete image of all the UTXOs available for spending. SPV nodes verify transactions differently, relying on peers to offer partial views of relevant areas of the blockchain on-demand. SPV validates transactions based on their depth in the blockchain rather than their height. An SPV node will verify the chain of all blocks (but not all transactions) and link that chain to the transaction of interest, whereas a full blockchain node will construct a fully verified chain of thousands of blocks and transactions reaching down the blockchain (back in time) all the way to the genesis block. Well-connected SPV nodes are safe enough for most practical tasks to balance resource requirements, practicality, and security. However, nothing surpasses operating a complete blockchain node for absolute security. SPV nodes provide a privacy concern since they must obtain individual transactions in order to selectively validate them. In contrast to full blockchain nodes, which gather all transactions inside each block, SPV node requests for particular data may mistakenly leak the addresses in their wallet. A third party monitoring a network, for example, may keep track of all transactions requested by a wallet on an SPV node and use them to link bitcoin addresses to the user of that wallet, violating the user's anonymity.\"]]],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[0],1,\"Bloom Filter\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"A Bloom filter is a type of probabilistic search filter that may be used to define the desired pattern without stating it precisely. In addition, Bloom filters are a quick and easy method to convey a search pattern while safeguarding your privacy. SPV nodes use them to ask their peers for transactions that fit a given pattern without exposing which addresses, keys, or transactions they are looking for. Bloom filters provide this role by allowing an SPV node to set a search pattern for transactions that may be optimized for precision or privacy. A more specialized bloom filter will yield more accurate results, but at the cost of disclosing the patterns, the SPV node is interested in revealing the addresses owned by the user's wallet.

An additional fee called a transaction fee is required\nfor a transaction to be made, which is paid to the miners.\n\nMining\nOn the Bitcoin network, the transaction will spread. It is not included in the\nblockchain until it is confirmed and included in a block through the mining\nprocess. Bitcoin's trust mechanism is built on computation. Transactions are\npackaged together in blocks, requiring a massive amount of computation to prove\nyet just a tiny amount of computation to check as proven.\n\nMining nodes do two jobs:\n\n * Mining nodes validate transactions based on consensus rules. Invalid\n   transactions will be rejected.\n * Create new bitcoins.\n\nMiners use electronic devices such as computers to perform mining. Miners will\nreceive a reward if they correctly confirm all the transactions according to the\nconsensus rules. The reward includes the new bitcoin and transaction fee.\n\nReferences: \n[1] Andreas M.

The simplest way\nto pass data from one component to another is to put it directly to the children\nthat require it as a prop. But how can we take the data from a deep component or\nrepeat it in many different parts? Here is when Redux and React Context come\ninto play. Although both of them are used to handle data in React, there are\nstill some things that make them distinctive.\n\nWhat is State Management?\nSince the state in React Apps can be represented in any data type as well as it\ncan be allocated throughout components, we need to manage the state. In simple\nwords, state management is a logic of storing and keeping track of data\ndisplayed on the front-end. For instance, it can tell us if the theme is set to\ndark or light, the button is switched on or off, and so on. In conclusion, state\nmanagement is a great way to synchronize the data across all elements and\ncommunicate with the backend. \n\nManaging state with React Context and Redux\nReact Context\nWith the arrival of React v16.3, React Context was introduced as a way to store\ndata and share them among components. But now, let's go through a real example\ncalled Counter. The Counter has an initial value of 0 and has two buttons to\nincrease and decrease its value.\n\n// counterReducer.js\n \nexport default counterReducer = (state, action) => {\n switch(action.type) {\n   case \"INCREASE_COUNTER\":\n     return {\n       ...state,\n       counter: state.counter + 1\n     }\n \n   case \"DECREASE_COUNTER\":\n     return {\n       ...state,\n       counter: state.counter - 1\n     }\n \n   default:\n     return state;\n }\n}\n\n/ Context API index.js\n \nimport React, { createContext, useReducer } from \"react\";\nimport counterReducer from '../counterReducer';\n \nconst initialState = {\n counter: 0\n}\nexport const GlobalContext = React.createContext(initialState);\nexport function CounterProvider({ children }) {\n const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);\n \n return (\n   <GlobalContext.Provider\n     value={{\n       state,\n       dispatch\n     }}\n   >\n     {children}\n   </GlobalContext.Provider>\n);\n}\n \nexport const useCounterContext = () => React.useContext(GlobalContext);\n\n\n…and import it into “App.js”\n\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { GlobalContext } from \"./globalState\";\nimport { Main } from \"./Main\";\n \nexport const App = () => {\n return (\n   <GlobalContext>\n     <Main />\n   </GlobalContext>\n )\n}\n\n\nTo use it inside the component, we just need to import useCounterContext from\n“globalState”.\n\n// Main.js\n \nimport { useCounterContext } from \"./globalState\";\n \nexport const Main = () => {\n const { state, dispatch } = useCounterContext();\n \n return (\n   <div>\n     <p>Counter : {state}</p>\n     <button\n       onClick={() => dispatch({\n         type: \"INCREASE_COUNTER\"\n       })}\n     >\n       Increase\n     </button>\n     <button\n       onClick={() => dispatch({\n         type: \"DECREASE_COUNTER\"\n       })}\n     >\n       Decrease\n     </button>\n   </div>\n )\n};\n \n \n\n\nThat’s all! So easy for everyone to understand. \n\nRedux\nRedux, for years, has always been known as the most popular way for state\nmanagement, but it is much more complicated than React Context. Thus, there will\nbe a lot of obstacles for beginners who are just starting to learn and work with\nReact.\n\nTo know what it really is and how to implement it let’s go to the same example\nas above with Counter. Remember that Redux requires three different blocks to\nfunction, including Actions, Reducers, and Store. Below are examples of them:\n\n// action.js\n \nexport const increase = () => {\n return {\n   type: \"INCREASE_COUNTER\",\n }\n};\n \nexport const decrease = () => {\n return {\n   type: \"DECREASE_COUNTER\",\n }\n}\n \n\n\n// reducer.js\n \nlet initialState = {\n counter: 0,\n}\n \nexport default counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {\n switch(action.type) {\n   case \"INCREASE_COUNTER\":\n     return {\n       ...state,\n       counter: state.counter + 1,\n     }\n \n   case \"DECREASE_COUNTER\":\n     return {\n       ...state,\n       counter: state.counter - 1,\n     }\n \n   default:\n     return state\n }\n}\n\n\n// store.js\n \nimport { createStore } from \"redux\";\nimport counterReducer from \"./reducer\";\n \nexport const store = createStore(counterReducer);\n\nNext, to make the Store accessible in our application and its children\ncomponents, we also need to import it into “App.js”\n\n// App.js\n \nimport { Provider } from \"react-redux\";\nimport { Main } from \"./Main\";\nimport { store } from \"./store\";\n \nexport default App = () => {\n return (\n   <Provider store={store}>\n     <Main />\n   </Provider>\n )\n}\n\n\nAfter that, to access the state and make a change, we can use useSelector() and\nuseDispatch() hooks by importing them from “react-redux”:\n\n// Main.js\n \nimport { useSelector, useDispatch } from \"react-redux\";\nimport { increase, decrease } from \"./action\";\n \nexport const Main = () => {\n const counter = useSelector(state => state.counterReducer.counter);\n const dispatch = useDispatch();\n \n return (\n   <div>\n     <p>Counter : {counter}</p>\n     <button\n       onClick={() => dispatch(increase())}\n     >\n       Increase\n     </button>\n     <button\n       onClick={() => dispatch(decrease())}\n     >\n       Decrease\n     </button>\n   </div>\n )\n};\n\n\nThere are a lot of things that need to be done, and, as you can see, using Redux\nis tougher than using React Context. \n\nThe differences between React Context and Redux\nAfter going through all examples, it’s time for us to make a comparison between\nthem:\n\nReact Context\n\nRedux\n\nThe Built-in tool that is already available in React\n\nA state management library\n\nRequiring to create new files when adding new contexts\n\nEasy to extend since the ease of adding new data after initial setup\n\nHard to debug\n\nHave powerful Redux DevTools for debugging purposes\n\nEasier to understand and handle for beginners\n\nMay be misleading for beginners, even with Redux DevTools\n\nState is changeable\n\nThe state is read-only and can not update directly\n\nBetter to use with small applications\n\nLarger applications are more suitable\n\nConclusion\nAfter all, you may wonder which one is better for React Apps?

In particular, the rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the worldwide success of some large initial coin offerings (ICO) has raised public interest in developments in the digital world. One of the particularly interesting aspects of blockchain technology is decentralized consensus building, which is achieved through the application of various consensus mechanisms. Most blockchain projects use one of the three most popular consensus algorithms: Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), or Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). These mechanisms ensure that all participants have identical copies of the distributed database files.\"]]],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[1],1,\"CONSENSUS\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[1],1,\"Proof of Work (PoW)\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Unlike other consensus mechanisms, the proof-of-work mechanism requires a lot of energy and computing power to reach consensus, and therefore, it is a costly option. The basic idea is that so-called \\\"miners\\\" in a network must prove that they have engaged to some extent. Miners provide the computing power needed to maintain the blockchain and verify transactions. At the same time, the miners ensure the immunity of the network against hackers. They compete with each other to chain together a group of transactions called the \\\"chain of blocks\\\". The blockchain contains all verified transactions that all network participants can access. The miners use so-called hash functions, i.e., mathematical functions of fixed length. When solving math puzzles, the real challenge is that you have to get a result with certain properties derived from the hash function. By solving the arithmetic puzzles, it can be shown that the transactions (i.e., the calculation process) were carried out without errors. If the block is successfully mined, it is attached to the blockchain, and the first miner to solve the math puzzle is rewarded. The most well-known cryptocurrency that uses the Proof-of-Work mechanism is Bitcoin.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[1],1,\"Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Proof of Stake (PoS) aims to separate a miner's voting power from their computing power,  i.e., PoS grants mining power based on the percentage of tokens a miner owns. The higher the share of the total number of tokens, the more likely the miner will be chosen to mine the next block.. However, the proof-of-stake mechanism uses a random algorithm to generate consensus. Although the number of tokens held (\\\"stake\\\") is relevant (since the ratio influences the likelihood that a miner will be allowed or selected to mine the next block), several other factors play a role in the selection of the next miner. The main goal of the PoS is to ensure that the miners support the blockchain project in the long term.

In DPoS, those with the most tokens are not eligible to confirm or validate transactions. Instead, all token holders elect a group of proxies to perform this task. The mechanism remains decentralized since all network users have the right to choose the group of miners who will confirm the transactions. On the other hand, the advantage of the centralized aspect of DPoS over the PoS mechanism is the higher verification and transaction speed, resulting in high scalability. The EOS project, as well as Lisk, use the DPoS-mechanism.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[1],1,\"Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The consensus mechanisms explored so far work well when network participants are not trusted—that is, they work well with public or permissionless networks. This next section deals with those consensus mechanisms in which network participants are trusted; PBFT is among the most well-known examples. PBFT works best in cases where network participants are at least partially trusted, i.e., authorized networks. It predates blockchains in terms of underlying theory but has been applied to blockchain networks with some success. It can be viewed as a Proof of Authority (PoA) mechanism where nodes stake their identity and reputation instead of a financial or computational stake such as PoW and PoS. This means that identities are known, and therefore networks are likely to be centralized. Nodes in PBFT are arranged sequentially and constantly communicate to keep network performance high.

Thus, To solve this problem, all nodes communicate with each other. The goal is for all honest nodes to agree on the state of the network by majority consensus. Honest nodes are more likely to agree on the state of a network than rogue nodes that agree on a wrong decision. Therefore, most of them should reject the wrong information. Nodes in the system share messages when deciding whether to send a block up the chain. This ensures that a message originated from a specific peer node and has not been modified in transit. These messages take the form of four rounds, known as \\\"views,\\\" suggested by the leader. If a view has taken too long, the nodes can agree on a timeout.

The mechanisms used in permissionless networks tend to focus more on security, ensuring consensus is reached between untrusted nodes. The mechanisms used in permissioned networks sacrifice decentralization for settlement finality and faster transaction rates. However, the mechanisms still cause some limitations for blockchain systems. With PoW, this side needs an expensive computer computing process to create a new block, and others will be wasting energy as many miners compete to create a block in one case. PoS is the most popular alternative to PoW, but the blockchain is controlled by the parties holding the most shares. DPoS is an extension of PoS where holders of shares use their shares to vote for delegates to increase the reliability and speed of consensus in the system. With PoET, it is currently the consensus model of choice for the hyperledger Sawtooth's modular framework. This mechanism can prevent the use of high resources and energy consumption, but users of the blockchain must rely on an Intel hardware module to combat fraud. PBFT is also a popular consensus mechanism, which does not consume a lot of resources, but the scalability is quite poor.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[1],1,\"REFERENCE\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],0,\"[1] Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain Technology by \"],[0,[2],1,\"Aurelia Nick\"],[0,[],0,\" and \"],[0,[3],2,\"Lukas Hoenig\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],0,\"[2] Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain by \"],[0,[4],2,\"Andreas M.

In particular, the rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the worldwide success of some large initial coin offerings (ICO) has raised public interest in developments in the digital world. One of the particularly interesting aspects of blockchain technology is decentralized consensus building, which is achieved through the application of various consensus mechanisms. Most blockchain projects use one of the three most popular consensus algorithms: Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), or Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). These mechanisms ensure that all participants have identical copies of the distributed database files.</em></p><h2 id=\"consensus\"><strong>CONSENSUS</strong></h2><h3 id=\"proof-of-work-pow\"><strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong></h3><p>Unlike other consensus mechanisms, the proof-of-work mechanism requires a lot of energy and computing power to reach consensus, and therefore, it is a costly option. The basic idea is that so-called \"miners\" in a network must prove that they have engaged to some extent. Miners provide the computing power needed to maintain the blockchain and verify transactions. At the same time, the miners ensure the immunity of the network against hackers. They compete with each other to chain together a group of transactions called the \"chain of blocks\". The blockchain contains all verified transactions that all network participants can access. The miners use so-called hash functions, i.e., mathematical functions of fixed length. When solving math puzzles, the real challenge is that you have to get a result with certain properties derived from the hash function. By solving the arithmetic puzzles, it can be shown that the transactions (i.e., the calculation process) were carried out without errors. If the block is successfully mined, it is attached to the blockchain, and the first miner to solve the math puzzle is rewarded. The most well-known cryptocurrency that uses the Proof-of-Work mechanism is Bitcoin.</p><h3 id=\"proof-of-stake-pos\"><strong>Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong></h3><p>Proof of Stake (PoS) aims to separate a miner's voting power from their computing power,  i.e., PoS grants mining power based on the percentage of tokens a miner owns. The higher the share of the total number of tokens, the more likely the miner will be chosen to mine the next block.. However, the proof-of-stake mechanism uses a random algorithm to generate consensus. Although the number of tokens held (\"stake\") is relevant (since the ratio influences the likelihood that a miner will be allowed or selected to mine the next block), several other factors play a role in the selection of the next miner. The main goal of the PoS is to ensure that the miners support the blockchain project in the long term. Projects using the PoS mechanism include Dash and Neo.</p><h3 id=\"delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos\"><strong>Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)</strong></h3><p>The DPoS mechanism can be seen as a more democratic evolution of the PoS mechanism. In DPoS, those with the most tokens are not eligible to confirm or validate transactions. Instead, all token holders elect a group of proxies to perform this task. The mechanism remains decentralized since all network users have the right to choose the group of miners who will confirm the transactions. On the other hand, the advantage of the centralized aspect of DPoS over the PoS mechanism is the higher verification and transaction speed, resulting in high scalability. The EOS project, as well as Lisk, use the DPoS-mechanism.</p><h3 id=\"practical-byzantine-fault-tolerance-pbft\"><strong>Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)</strong></h3><p>The consensus mechanisms explored so far work well when network participants are not trusted—that is, they work well with public or permissionless networks. This next section deals with those consensus mechanisms in which network participants are trusted; PBFT is among the most well-known examples. PBFT works best in cases where network participants are at least partially trusted, i.e., authorized networks. It predates blockchains in terms of underlying theory but has been applied to blockchain networks with some success. It can be viewed as a Proof of Authority (PoA) mechanism where nodes stake their identity and reputation instead of a financial or computational stake such as PoW and PoS. This means that identities are known, and therefore networks are likely to be centralized. Nodes in PBFT are arranged sequentially and constantly communicate to keep network performance high. There is a primary node, also known as a \"lead\" node, and multiple backup nodes. </p><p>PBFT believes that some of these nodes are likely to be fraudulent and, therefore, send malicious or fake messages.  Thus, To solve this problem, all nodes communicate with each other. The goal is for all honest nodes to agree on the state of the network by majority consensus. Honest nodes are more likely to agree on the state of a network than rogue nodes that agree on a wrong decision. Therefore, most of them should reject the wrong information. Nodes in the system share messages when deciding whether to send a block up the chain. This ensures that a message originated from a specific peer node and has not been modified in transit. These messages take the form of four rounds, known as \"views,\" suggested by the leader. If a view has taken too long, the nodes can agree on a timeout. Guide nodes can be modified after each view.</p><h3 id=\"proof-of-elapsed-time-poet\"><strong>Proof Of Elapsed Time (PoET)</strong></h3><p>Proof of elapsed time is an underlying agreement mechanism that Intel has first projected to enhance energy efficiency and eliminate the waste of resources. PoET is very keen on dedicated hardware to limit cooperation and decentralization. PoET reaches agreement by the random selection of block leaders wherever the winning odds are unfolded equally throughout the network. Every node holds a constant probability of turning into the winner.</p><p>The following are some popular consensus algorithms and some popular platforms, respectively.‌</p><p><strong><em>                                       Table 1.

The mechanisms used in permissionless networks tend to focus more on security, ensuring consensus is reached between untrusted nodes. The mechanisms used in permissioned networks sacrifice decentralization for settlement finality and faster transaction rates. However, the mechanisms still cause some limitations for blockchain systems. With PoW, this side needs an expensive computer computing process to create a new block, and others will be wasting energy as many miners compete to create a block in one case. PoS is the most popular alternative to PoW, but the blockchain is controlled by the parties holding the most shares. DPoS is an extension of PoS where holders of shares use their shares to vote for delegates to increase the reliability and speed of consensus in the system. With PoET, it is currently the consensus model of choice for the hyperledger Sawtooth's modular framework. This mechanism can prevent the use of high resources and energy consumption, but users of the blockchain must rely on an Intel hardware module to combat fraud. PBFT is also a popular consensus mechanism, which does not consume a lot of resources, but the scalability is quite poor.</p><h3 id=\"reference\"><strong>REFERENCE</strong></h3><p><em>[1] Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain Technology by <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/17192/author/Aurelia_Nick/\">Aurelia Nick</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/17192/author/Lukas_Hoenig/\">Lukas Hoenig</a></em></p><p><em>[2] Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain by <a href=\"https://www.google.com.vn/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Andreas+M.+Antonopoulos%22\">Andreas M. Antonopoulos</a></em></p>","comment_id":"625d4ddd72b2fcaed5080c2d","plaintext":"The so-called blockchain technology or \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" (DLT) has\ndeveloped rapidly in recent years. In particular, the rise in the value of\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the worldwide success of some large\ninitial coin offerings (ICO) has raised public interest in developments in the\ndigital world. One of the particularly interesting aspects of blockchain\ntechnology is decentralized consensus building, which is achieved through the\napplication of various consensus mechanisms. Most blockchain projects use one of\nthe three most popular consensus algorithms: Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake\n(PoS), or Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). These mechanisms ensure that all\nparticipants have identical copies of the distributed database files.\n\nCONSENSUS\nProof of Work (PoW)\nUnlike other consensus mechanisms, the proof-of-work mechanism requires a lot of\nenergy and computing power to reach consensus, and therefore, it is a costly\noption. The basic idea is that so-called \"miners\" in a network must prove that\nthey have engaged to some extent. Miners provide the computing power needed to\nmaintain the blockchain and verify transactions. At the same time, the miners\nensure the immunity of the network against hackers. They compete with each other\nto chain together a group of transactions called the \"chain of blocks\". The\nblockchain contains all verified transactions that all network participants can\naccess. The miners use so-called hash functions, i.e., mathematical functions of\nfixed length. When solving math puzzles, the real challenge is that you have to\nget a result with certain properties derived from the hash function. By solving\nthe arithmetic puzzles, it can be shown that the transactions (i.e., the\ncalculation process) were carried out without errors. If the block is\nsuccessfully mined, it is attached to the blockchain, and the first miner to\nsolve the math puzzle is rewarded. The most well-known cryptocurrency that uses\nthe Proof-of-Work mechanism is Bitcoin.\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS)\nProof of Stake (PoS) aims to separate a miner's voting power from their\ncomputing power,  i.e., PoS grants mining power based on the percentage of\ntokens a miner owns. The higher the share of the total number of tokens, the\nmore likely the miner will be chosen to mine the next block.. However, the\nproof-of-stake mechanism uses a random algorithm to generate consensus. Although\nthe number of tokens held (\"stake\") is relevant (since the ratio influences the\nlikelihood that a miner will be allowed or selected to mine the next block),\nseveral other factors play a role in the selection of the next miner. The main\ngoal of the PoS is to ensure that the miners support the blockchain project in\nthe long term. Projects using the PoS mechanism include Dash and Neo.\n\nDelegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)\nThe DPoS mechanism can be seen as a more democratic evolution of the PoS\nmechanism. In DPoS, those with the most tokens are not eligible to confirm or\nvalidate transactions. Instead, all token holders elect a group of proxies to\nperform this task. The mechanism remains decentralized since all network users\nhave the right to choose the group of miners who will confirm the transactions.\nOn the other hand, the advantage of the centralized aspect of DPoS over the PoS\nmechanism is the higher verification and transaction speed, resulting in high\nscalability. The EOS project, as well as Lisk, use the DPoS-mechanism.\n\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)\nThe consensus mechanisms explored so far work well when network participants are\nnot trusted—that is, they work well with public or permissionless networks. This\nnext section deals with those consensus mechanisms in which network participants\nare trusted; PBFT is among the most well-known examples. PBFT works best in\ncases where network participants are at least partially trusted, i.e.,\nauthorized networks. It predates blockchains in terms of underlying theory but\nhas been applied to blockchain networks with some success. It can be viewed as a\nProof of Authority (PoA) mechanism where nodes stake their identity and\nreputation instead of a financial or computational stake such as PoW and PoS.\nThis means that identities are known, and therefore networks are likely to be\ncentralized. Nodes in PBFT are arranged sequentially and constantly communicate\nto keep network performance high. There is a primary node, also known as a\n\"lead\" node, and multiple backup nodes. \n\nPBFT believes that some of these nodes are likely to be fraudulent and,\ntherefore, send malicious or fake messages.  Thus, To solve this problem, all\nnodes communicate with each other. The goal is for all honest nodes to agree on\nthe state of the network by majority consensus. Honest nodes are more likely to\nagree on the state of a network than rogue nodes that agree on a wrong decision.\nTherefore, most of them should reject the wrong information. Nodes in the system\nshare messages when deciding whether to send a block up the chain. This ensures\nthat a message originated from a specific peer node and has not been modified in\ntransit. These messages take the form of four rounds, known as \"views,\"\nsuggested by the leader. If a view has taken too long, the nodes can agree on a\ntimeout.

The mechanisms used in\npermissionless networks tend to focus more on security, ensuring consensus is\nreached between untrusted nodes. The mechanisms used in permissioned networks\nsacrifice decentralization for settlement finality and faster transaction rates.\nHowever, the mechanisms still cause some limitations for blockchain systems.\nWith PoW, this side needs an expensive computer computing process to create a\nnew block, and others will be wasting energy as many miners compete to create a\nblock in one case. PoS is the most popular alternative to PoW, but the\nblockchain is controlled by the parties holding the most shares. DPoS is an\nextension of PoS where holders of shares use their shares to vote for delegates\nto increase the reliability and speed of consensus in the system. With PoET, it\nis currently the consensus model of choice for the hyperledger Sawtooth's\nmodular framework. This mechanism can prevent the use of high resources and\nenergy consumption, but users of the blockchain must rely on an Intel hardware\nmodule to combat fraud. PBFT is also a popular consensus mechanism, which does\nnot consume a lot of resources, but the scalability is quite poor.\n\nREFERENCE\n[1] Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain Technology by Aurelia Nick\n[https://www.lexology.com/17192/author/Aurelia_Nick/] and Lukas Hoenig\n[https://www.lexology.com/17192/author/Lukas_Hoenig/]\n\n[2] Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain by Andreas M.\nAntonopoulos\n[https://www.google.com.vn/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22Andreas+M.+Antonopoulos%22]","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/POPULAR-CONSENSUS-MECHANISMS-AND-COMPARISON.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dc6","created_at":"2022-04-18 11:39:09","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 10:30:50","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-04-20 11:28:22","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e42","uuid":"6f733dfb-7c77-4111-968f-ab4006a4b8db","title":"PROOF-OF-WORK (POW)","slug":"proof-of-work-pow","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xw0Fnr2Elf0rzW03TZDpkxijTD-3err6fGduCXKcO5Hk7RXpmP6lN9IWMjbiescWWL4_M-QjfpNUCZTCX_3-zamqHJNmvQ4cjQNeouidhGSSS0wasf7XsTLwgmyNIwpq6RaI2HEI\",\"alt\":\"Graphical user interface, application\\n\\nDescription automatically generated\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/od22XPI93kp1KYie3KZ6BvyjvTYxMIVCaFKj1NzLac4ss2SvsraXSFvoIR97xGUZfC5LNaqFuxGq2sogS46VmlkpEcBBU8VCpJz-q_n_LL_jpb4V_5lCRrbPTdJHhnhTuCKwTxu1\",\"alt\":\"Text\\n\\nDescription automatically generated\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/m44I5xzCVn2VCa7q13tL9OHwT_0Gsey2RjzQFqg58AW0U4eN_HNP-3K86kD8NObmZ1c7hhIxWPLSMNW8jwvlGfIESI8Pt4sC5Kfl9fhvMXSVWzB0-hKvTj0XeVdJkTfb594T-09P\",\"alt\":\"Text\\n\\nDescription automatically generated\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<table cellspacing=\\\"0\\\" style=\\\"border-collapse:collapse; border-color:initial; border-style:none; border-width:initial; width:829px\\\">\\n\\t<tbody>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td style=\\\"border-color:#000000; border-style:solid; vertical-align:top; width:413px\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><strong><span style=\\\"font-size:12pt\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family:'Times New Roman'\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">Pros</span></span></span></strong></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td style=\\\"border-color:#000000; border-style:solid; vertical-align:top; width:408px\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p style=\\\"text-align:center\\\"><strong><span style=\\\"font-size:12pt\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family:'Times New Roman'\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">Cons</span></span></span></strong></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td style=\\\"border-color:#000000; border-style:solid; vertical-align:top; width:413px\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<p style=\\\"text-align:justify\\\"><span style=\\\"font-size:12pt\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family:'Times New Roman'\\\"><span style=\\\"color:#000000\\\">Proof-of-work is neutral.

Antonopoulos</a></em></p>","comment_id":"625e767072b2fcaed5080cce","plaintext":"Bitcoin presently uses an agreement protocol referred to as proof-of-work (PoW).\nThat allows the Bitcoin network nodes to agree on the state of all information\nrecorded on the Bitcoin blockchain and prevents certain kinds of economic\nattacks.\n\nWHAT IS PROOF-OF-WORK (POW)?\nThis explanation focuses on proof of work as it works on the Bitcoin network.\nBitcoin is a digital currency secured by a distributed ledger known as a\n\"blockchain.\" This ledger keeps a record of all bitcoin transactions organized\ninto consecutive \"blocks\" so that no user can spend any of their holdings twice.\nIn addition, the ledger is public or \"distributed,\" which helps to prevent\ntampering. In this case, if any modifications appear, they will quickly be\nrejected by other users.\n\nIn practice, users detect tampering based on hashes, long strings of numbers\nthat serve as proof of work. Run a given record through a hash function (Bitcoin\nuses SHA256), and only a hash is generated (Example 1).  However, due to the\n\"avalanche effect\", even a small change to any part of the original data will\nresult in a completely unrecognizable hash (Example 2). Regardless of the size\nof the original record, the hash generated by a given function is the same\nlength. The hash is a one-way function: it cannot be used to retrieve the\noriginal data, only to verify that the data that generated the hash matches the\noriginal data.\n\nExample 1:\n\nResult: 1c54a38ac265306c2af248416451386b8c57cc2ceb50f5b38a8e255b975cd744\n\nExample 2:\n\nResult:\n\nGiven that a given record can only generate one hash, how do miners ensure they\ngenerate a hash below the target? They modify the input by adding an integer\ncalled a nonce (\"one-time-use\"). Once a valid hash is found, it is broadcast to\nthe network, and the block is added to the blockchain.\n\nGenerating an arbitrary hash for a series of bitcoin transactions would be\ntrivial for a modern computer. So, in order to turn the process into “work”, the\nbitcoin network sets a certain level of “difficulty”. This setting is adjusted\nto \"mine\" a new block approximately every 10 minutes, which is added to the\nblockchain by generating a valid hash. The configuration difficulty is achieved\nby setting a \"goal\" for the hash: the lower the goal, the smaller the set of\nvalid hashes, and the more difficult it is.\n\nProof-of-work makes it extremely difficult to change any aspect of the\nblockchain, as such a change would require re-mining all subsequent blocks.\nAlso, it becomes difficult for one user or group of users to monopolize the\ncomputing power of the network because the machines and power required to find a\nvalid hash are expensive.\n\nFINALITY\nA transaction has \"finality\" on Bitcoin when it's part of a block that can't\nchange.\n\nBecause miners add a suburbanized way, 2 valid blocks will get well-mined at\nconstant time. This creates a brief fork. Eventually, one among these chains can\nbecome the accepted chain once a resultant block is mined and added, making it\nlonger. However, to complicate things further, dealings rejected on the\ntemporary fork could be enclosed within the accepted chain. That implies it may\nget reversed. Thus determinateness refers to the time you ought to wait before\nconsidering a transaction irreversible. For Bitcoin, the counseled time is six\nblocks or simply over one minute. Once six blocks, you'll say with relative\nconfidence that the dealing was successful. You'll wait longer for even larger\nassurances. Determinateness are a few things in contact in mind once coming up\nwith DApps. It might be poor user expertise to misrepresent transaction info to\nyour users, particularly if the transaction is of high value. Remember, this\ntemporal order doesn't embody the wait times for having a transaction picked up\nby a miner.\n\nPROOF-OF-WORK AND SECURITY\nMiners are incentivized to try and do this work on the most Bitcoin chain.\nThere's a minimal incentive for a set of miners to begin their own chain – it\nundermines the system. Blockchains have confidence in having one state as a\nsupply of truth. And users can invariably opt for the longest or \"heaviest\"\nchain. The target of proof-of-work is to increase the chain. The longest chain\nis most plausible because the valid one had the foremost procedure work done as\na result of it. Inside Bitcoins, it's nearly impossible to form new blocks that\nerase transactions, create tampering ones, or maintain a second chain. To\nsystematically produce malicious however valid blocks, you'd need over 51% of\nthe network mining power to beat everyone else. You'd need heaps of computing\npower to be ready to do that quantity of \"work\". And therefore, the energy spent\nwould possibly even outweigh the gains you'd build in an attack.\n\nPROOF-OF-WORK ECONOMICS\nProof-of-work is also liable for issuing new currency into the system and\nincentivizing miners to try to do the work. Miners who successfully create a\nblock get rewarded with some freshly minted BTC.\n\nPROOF-OF-WORK ENERGY-USAGE\nA major criticism of proof-of-work is the quantity of energy output needed to\nkeep the network safe. To maintain security and decentralization, Bitcoin on\nproof-of-work consumes tens of TWh annually, the energy equivalent of a\nmedium-sized country.\n\nPROS AND CONS\nPros\n\nCons\n\nProof-of-work is neutral. You don't need BTC to get started, and block rewards\nallow you to go from 0 BTC to a positive balance. With proof-of-stake, you need\nBTC to start with.\n\nProof-of-work uses up most energy that it's unhealthy for the environment.\n\nProof-of-work is a tried and tested consensus mechanism that has kept Bitcoin\nsecure and decentralized for many years.\n\nIf you would like to mine, you would like such specialized instrumentality that\nit’s an enormous investment to start.\n\nCompared to PoS, it's relatively easy to implement.\n\nDue to increasing computation needed, mining pools could potentially dominate\nthe mining game, leading to centralization and security risks.\n\nREFERENCE\n[1] Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain by Andreas M.\nAntonopoulos\n[https://www.google.com.vn/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22Andreas+M.+Antonopoulos%22]","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/Proof-Of-Work--POW-.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dc6","created_at":"2022-04-19 08:44:32","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 10:25:04","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-04-19 08:59:11","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e43","uuid":"dd149bfe-fe49-4a6e-b598-e4696823e0e8","title":"IPFS -

It is a big problem for IPFS because non-tech\n   users don't want to waste their storage; they will delete cached or data that\n   they don't need to use anymore.\n * The costs for maintaining the network would skyrocket.\n * Implementing IPFS still exists because the WWW/HTTP are so widespread in use\n   - evolving existing protocols incrementally seems more likely than changing\n   paradigms.\n\nOpportunities\nIPFS has a significant opportunity to replace HTTP and build a better web for\nall of us. Can it be true or not?\n\nIPFS is a special fundament, so there are many applications and use cases that\ncan be built on top of IPFS:\n\n * The global marketplace for data storage: https://filecoin.io/\n * Query the DWeb across blockchains: https://thegraph.com\n * Share files: https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop or https://enzypt.io/\n * Collaborate: https://peerpad.net/\n * P2P video streaming platform: http://www.blust.tv/\n * IPFS as infrastructure: https://cluster.ipfs.io/or https://www.npmjs.com/\n * Decentralized database: https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db\n * Deploy your website on IPFS: https://fleek.co/\n * Build a dApp: https://fission.codes/; https://fleek.co/ or \n   https://linktr.ee/textileio\n\nThreats\n * Leak sensitive information like banking information, accounts, messages,...\n * Hard to remove data publish on the IPFS networks\n * Waste storage because of resident data mechanism\n * Not enough nodes participate in the network.\n   \n\nConclusion\nFigure 2: Rank of FIL on coingecko.com [https://www.coingecko.com]With its\nsuperior features, IPFS has great potential to create a new revolution that can\ncomplete or even replace HTTP, completely changing the way people access and use\nthe internet. Currently, many applications are being built on top of IPFS that\nattract many users and have proven the superiority of this network. For example,\nFile Coin with FIL token is ranked 39 on coigeckco.com, or The Graph with GRT is\nranked 50. However, IPFS still has many unfinished weaknesses. Therefore, the\nuse of IPFS as an infrastructure to build and develop applications needs to be\nconsidered carefully.\n\nReferences\n[1] https://docs.ipfs.io/\n\n[2] https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interplanetary-file-system/\n\n[3] https://moralis.io/what-is-ipfs-interplanetary-file-system/\n\n[4] https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/CSG/teaching/FS21/IFI_2021_02.pdf#page=78\n\n[5] https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f[6] \nhttps://blog.neocities.org/blog/2015/09/08/its-time-for-the-distributed-web.html","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/photo_2022-04-19_17-04-55.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dcb","created_at":"2022-04-19 09:36:48","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 07:15:07","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-04-19 10:04:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e44","uuid":"9543a5ce-353f-4ea2-82f5-08a1e41a651d","title":"Application Transition From Web2.0 To Web3.0","slug":"application-transition-from-web2-0-to-web3-0","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/REpJ0VH7wrUnJ-5GTDJMnXmDshaWBab0jc29q8jXzaUahLnJycVGhHDpMfxWUHCaF9OaPptQMTyuHBmpu0cMorbtiyl7ESea3ktjuKf7cm9mCsjkkZFKkVfQyuFyZ3SzwIvHbbGR\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"<em>Web 2 to Web 3.

But what do Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 mean? What makes the\ntransition to Web 3.0 so inevitable?\n\nWeb 2.0 and Web 3.0\nWeb 2.0\nFor a better understanding of the meaning of Web 2.0, first, it is necessary to\ngo back to the time when Web 1.0 was born. In this phase, web pages are static\npages (Static Web) - where content is served from the server's file system.\nWhat's more, these pages are non-interactive. You cannot react to posts with\ncomments or likes. Instead, you are just passively receiving information.\n\nThe web in this day has a very rudimentary interface. For example, developers\nused frames and tables to position and align elements on a page because CSS\ndidn't exist.\n\nAfter Web 1.0 came the era of Web 2.0, which is the web we are using today.\nInstead of static content, the web has become a place where users can interact\nwith content published on it, thanks to the advent of technologies like\nJavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\n\nThese websites can be social networks, blogs, podcasting, or e-commerce webs –\nWeb 2.0 is completely interactive. We interact with the web and with each other\nthrough comments, and we can easily attach additional content such as images and\nsounds to many others. Some of the famous Web 2.0 applications can be mentioned\nas Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and Google. That is why this age of the web is\nalso known as the “Social Network” age.\n\nWeb 3.0\nWeb 3.0 is the third web generation. Instead of only searching for content based\non keywords or numbers, we can use AI to understand the semantics of content on\nthe web. That will allow machines to understand and interpret information like\nhumans (instead of following patterns like normal machines). The primary purpose\nof the Semantic Web is to enable users to more easily find, share, and combine\ninformation.\n\nToday, however, the term Web 3.0 is broader: data will be interconnected in a\ndecentralized way. That would be a huge step up from the current internet\ngeneration (Web 2.0), where data is mainly stored in centralized repositories.\nFurthermore, users and machines will be able to interact with the data. But to\ndo this, programs need to understand information both conceptually and in\ncontext. With this in mind, Web 3.0 has two platforms: semantic web, artificial\nintelligence, and of course, blockchain.\n\nCompare Web 2.0 to Web 3.0\nWith Web 2.0, users' data is stored in bulk on centralized servers, and Google,\nFacebook, and Twitter are the custodians. As a result, users have had to\nsacrifice information security for the convenience of these services. Whether\nthey know it or not, their identity, browsing habits, searches, chats, and\nonline shopping information have been sold to a third party.\n\nMeanwhile, Web 3.0 allows connecting devices through a decentralized network\ninstead of a centralized database on servers. With this phase, Web 3.0 exhibits\nthe following characteristics:\n\n * No third party intermediaries\n * Ensure data privacy and security\n * Service without interruption\n\nApplication transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0\nIt seems that this transition is quite easy when just applying blockchain to\neach application. But behind that, the way to connect users to digital services\nis markedly different. Transactions must be signed and verified manually to\nprevent platforms from taking away personal information. For the transformation\nto occur, Web 2.0-based applications need to have corresponding replacement\nproducts on Web 3.0 platforms to serve users' activities.\n\n\nWeb 2 to Web 3. Source:\nhttps://medium.com/@essentia1/why-the-web-3-0-matters-and-you-should-know-about-it-a5851d63c949 * \n   Instead of using operating systems like iOS and Android, frameworks like\n   Essentia and EOS provide a new gateway to the web.\n * \n   To store folders and files, instead of Google Drive or Dropbox, we have\n   services like Storj, Siacoin, Filecoin, or IPFS technology to distribute and\n   store files.\n * \n   For video calling, instead of Skype, we have platforms like Experty.io.\n * \n   To send messages, instead of WhatsApp and WeChat, we have Status.\n * \n   Akasha or Steemit would play the role of Facebook, the Brave browser would\n   act as Chrome, and Ethlance could take over Upwork.\n\nHere are some detailed side-by-side comparisons of apps from the two generations\nto show how the transition has impacted.\n\nBrave vs. Chrome\nBoth Brave and Chrome are Chromium-based web browsers. While Chrome adds some\nproprietary elements to make it more powerful, Brave is an open-source web\nbrowser that reinforces privacy and security.\n\nUnlike Chrome, Brave blocks third-party ads and cookies by default. Brave also\nlimits the amount of data Facebook, Google, and other ad networks can collect\nabout browsing habits.\n\nBrave stores all browsing data locally on the computer, and users can delete all\nthat data at any time. In addition, Brave also supports Tor browsing, making it\nthe first all-in-one web browser to do so.\n\nIn terms of security, Brave automatically encrypts website connections when\npossible (on Chrome, this only happens with extensions like HTTPS Everywhere).\n\nBrave's limitation lies in the user experience. While Chrome and its extensions\nuse users' data to help them browse the web better, Brave secures user data. In\naddition, it is quite inconvenient to be able to sync Brave on many different\ndevices. Brave now supports almost all Chrome extensions.\n\nIn general, if you don't need to visit unusual websites, it might be fine to use\nChrome. And if you're a privacy enthusiast, Brave will be a better choice.\n\nIPFS vs. Google Drive\nGoogle Drive is currently one of the leading free storage tools provided by\nGoogle. However, data stored on Google Drive is dependent on Google's servers,\nso the privacy and availability of data cannot be fully guaranteed as hackers\ncan attack this server.\n\nMeanwhile, IPFS - InterPlanetary File System is content and identity-based data\ndistribution protocol that allows users to share files peer-to-peer without\nphysical presence. The content the user uploads will be hashed and generated as\na code. The same content will always give the same hashes, thereby eliminating\nduplication by IPFS. Content when a node shares will be broken into pieces, they\nwill be delivered to the nodes near it in the network. Having content stored in\ndifferent nodes nearby will make them download faster, save bandwidth and ensure\ndata availability even if one or more nodes are attacked.\n\nWith a different way of working, IFPS used a decentralized network of nodes,\nthus eliminating the need for many docking stations and Internet servers,\nresulting in a marked reduction in overall costs.\n\nExperty.io vs. Skype\nExperty is a voice and video application that allows experts in their field to\nmonetize their time and knowledge on the Ethereum Blockchain. That is an\napplication where the payment is automated through a smart contract, which\nallows monetizing voice/video calls with no upfront payment.\n\nSimilar to Skype, people can exchange information through video calls. However,\nwith experts providing fee-based consultations, Experty's payment method shows\nmore efficiency. Experty will allow information sellers and knowledge buyers\nthrough video calls, and the transaction amount in exchange for information is\ndetermined by the time of the call, and that transaction will not go through any\nbank between the seller and the buyer.\n\nEssentia.one vs. Android\nEssentia.one is a system for creating, storing, accessing, and operating other\ndecentralized applications. It gives users full ownership and control over their\nidentities, data, wallets, and assets. In addition, they can join DApps and\ndecentralized web browsing easily from anywhere and on any device.\n\nUnlike Android or iOS, you don't need to re-enter passwords, back up, and change\ndevices to access your decentralized and centralized accounts. Having a seed\ngives you instant access to all your important personal and business logins.\n\nSteemit vs. Facebook\nSteemit is a Blockchain web application that pays users to write, participate,\nand explore. It is a new technology with a lot of potential for social network\nusers. Unlike Facebook, Steemit's business model allows content\ncreators/bloggers to make money while building a community.\n\nOn Facebook, users' posts will be moderated by the community and the censorship\nagencies. While Steemit is built on top of Blockchain technology, the community\nis censorship-free, although it can still allow third-party applications to use\nits technology.\n\nSteem Power - a token that acts as a measure of voting power in the Steemit\nsocial media platform. The platform is transparent and open-source, so people\ncan ensure that their information remains immune to manipulation. The underlying\nblockchain technology that powers Steem sees it as setting the pace of social\nmedia in the blockchain age. Steemit is unique in that it allows users to earn\nmoney by:\n\n * Post articles\n * Support content\n * Comments on articles\n\nFacebook is free, but users always collect personal data to monetize ads and\nsell user information on this social network.\n\nStatus vs. WhatsApp\nWhile Telegram and WhatsApp are popular choices, both instant messaging apps are\nweb 2.0 based, posing major security challenges. To overcome this security hole,\nStatus integrated cutting-edge blockchain technology with instant messaging.\n\nBased on web 3.0 and built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, Status is\npioneering a new era of decentralized instant messaging by enabling\npeer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted communication instead of the usual\nserver-client. In addition, it promotes secure messaging by giving users full\ncontrol over their information and providing the option of pseudo-anonymity.\n\nConclusion\nWeb 1.0 is the readable phase of the web. We see limited interaction between\nusers. Web 2.0 was the web's writable phase, a stage where users could interact\nwith the web and interact with each other. Web 3.0 is the operable stage of the\nweb. Here, computers can interpret information like humans and create\npersonalized content for each user.\n\nSimultaneously with the technology transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 is the\ntransformation of applications that allow use on those technology platforms.\n\nReferences\n[1] What do Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 mean?

The application of blockchain technology with the removal of\nthe trust factor, eliminating the need for a third party in the transaction, has\ncreated really great experiences and products.\n\nWith Web 3.0, users can access information even more easily, with the advent of\na series of new generation smart devices thanks to the internet of things\ntechnology, and then, cyberspace is no longer restricted to computers or\nsmartphones as in Web 2.0.\n\nWeb 3.0 allows the creation and distribution of content in the most appropriate\nway in each specific situation for internet users. Websites will intelligently\nprocess information like humans, through advanced technologies such as\nartificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data (big data),\ndecentralized ledger technology, etc.\n\nThe risks\nHowever, some experts argue that an anonymous and decentralized web cannot\nhandle some harmful contents, wealth inequality between normal users and a small\ngroup of investors, or data inaccessibility due to the high cost based on\nblockchain technology. Many projects utilize the phrase \"Web3\" as a marketing\nbuzzword to attract investors and individuals, and some even exploit it to\nperpetrate fraud, while they do not have any decentralized solutions based on\nWeb3 technology in their projects. As a result, any investors or users\nconsidering investing in the \"Web3\" initiative should proceed with caution. [1]\n\nSome top web3 projects\nChainlink (LINK)\nChainlink, an Ethereum-based decentralized blockchain oracle network, is\ndesigned to make it easier to move tamper-proof data from off-chain to on-chain\nsmart contracts.\n\nFilecoin (FIL)\nFilecoin is a digital currency and payment system that has been integrated with\nIPFS to create a blockchain-based cooperative digital storage and retrieval\nsystem.\n\nThe Graph (GRT)\nThe graph is an indexing system for querying blockchain networks such as\nEthereum and IPFS that anybody can use to access data via its APIs, known as\nsubgraphs.\n\nLivepeer (LPT)\nLivepeer is a decentralized video live streaming service that was built on the\nEthereum blockchain \n\nAkasha (AKT)\nAkasha is the next generation of blockchain-based decentralized social network\nthat is built on the Ethereum network [10]\n\nConclusion\nWeb 3.0 is a very broad topic that only one of its applications, such as Crypto,\nrequires us to spend a lot of time learning and understanding. And in the same\nway that Crypto has changed and will change lives, other uses of Web 3.0 will\ncreate a massive shift in prosperity for the changing generations.\n\nPrevious generations of the Web took decades to develop and are gradually being\napplied more in life; similarly, Web 3.0 will be developed and applied gradually\nso that one day we will use it naturally as we use social networking platforms\nsuch as Facebook, Twitter, …\n\nThe advantages that Web 3.0 brings will gradually be linked together, helping to\ncreate a more seamless and effective experience where people are at the center.\nBesides, there are breakthroughs on a global scale when all physical limits are\nbroken and we are truly moving towards a flatter world than ever before.\n\nThe more time I spend digging deep, the more enormity of Web 3.0 I see.\nDifferent from the early stage when everything was ideal, Web 3.0 applications\nhave gradually come to life and have a breakneck development speed. What will\nour future look like in the next 5 to 10 years? I don't know, but I believe Web\n3.0 will play a significant role in that future.\n\nReferences.\n[1] Web3, Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3], accessed 10th March,\n2022. \n\n[2] Nader Dabit, What is Web3?

The birth of Ethereum turned blockchains from a mere storage\n   solution into a “virtual computer”, enabling a brand new field for\n   decentralized applications (dApps).\n * Nonetheless, the “virtual computer” approach of Ethereum still has some\n   performance and capacity limitations, which makes dApps not yet popular among\n   mass users. All of the meta-apps that shape the Internet nowadays, such as\n   Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc., are still hosted on centralized servers from\n   big corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google.\n * That’s why the idea of an Internet Computer was formed. The Internet Computer\n   is a blockchain that supports programmable applications like Ethereum, but\n   with better scalability, more powerful performance, and can serve data and\n   transactions at web speed. This ensures complicated applications can be\n   hosted on open-source blockchains instead of proprietary servers of big\n   corporations.\n\nAim\n * Solve the problem of monopolization of web service: the idea of Web3 is to\n   demonopolize the whole Internet, with applications running on several\n   distributed nodes instead of centralized servers. However, while there are\n   many decentralized protocols, most of them still heavily rely on corporate\n   infrastructures (70% of Ethereum nodes are running on centralized servers,\n   for example). The Internet Computer will be the solution as it consists of\n   independent data centers worldwide instead of nodes run by big corporations’\n   cloud services like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.\n   \n\nSource: https://www.dfinitycommunity.com/ * Facilitate decentralized\n   applications: the Internet Computer Protocol is claimed to be able to serve\n   distributed data at normal web speed, making decentralized applications more\n   accessible to mass users.\n\nTechnology\n * Canister smart contract: the traditional smart contracts on Ethereum\n   blockchain only contains codes, while the Internet Computer used  “canisters”\n   - a new form of smart contract that containerizes both the program and the\n   data about the application’s state inside a module. This method of\n   containerization allows faster and more nimble deployment as well as\n   maintenance.\n * Chain Key Technology: the blockchain only has one public key, significantly\n   reducing the amount of data needed in verifying transactions.\n * Network Nervous System (NNS): the governance system of the Internet Computer\n   that manages when and how to add new nodes to the network. The NNS follows a\n   DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) model, where decisions are made\n   based on votes from participants - users who lock their ICP token (the\n   utility token of Dfinity) into the system. This grants the Internet Computer\n   the ability to automatically scale up, adding new units when required.\n\nAnalysis\nStrength\n * Faster transaction:\n\nThe “Chain Key Technology” mentioned above allows every device (even smartphones\nor wearable devices) to fast and easily communicate with the platform.\n\nMoreover, the Internet Computer protocol also splits canister’s functions into\n“update call” and “query call”: Update calls are functions that modify the state\nof a smart contract, and must be processed on all nodes running that contract.\n“Query calls”, on the other hand, only need to be run on a single node, as they\nonly fetch and transmit data without modifying anything. Because query calls\ntake up 90% of the Internet Computer traffic, this separation is fundamental in\nspeeding up the activities on the blockchain.\n\nThe Chain Key Technology, combined with the separation between query calls from\nupdate calls, tremendously improves the speed of finalizing transactions on the\nInternet Computer (1-2 seconds per transaction, in contrast to 15 minutes on\nEthereum and 40 minutes on Bitcoin).\n\nThe Internet Computer shows outstanding speed in processing transactions.\nSource: Bitcoin Insider * Scalability: Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work consensus model can only support about\n   30 transactions per second, which will easily lead to congestion when network\n   traffic increases. The Internet Computer, in contrast, uses the Network\n   Nervous System with a Proof-of-Stake consensus model that can automatically\n   add new nodes into the network to increase capacity.\n * More cost-effective:\n\nThe Dfinity project claims that while the cost of computing tasks on a\nblockchain is more expensive than on centralized servers, software deployed on a\ndecentralized infrastructure will be tamper-proof, eliminating the risk of\nsecurity. Furthermore, the scalability task will also be transparent to\ndevelopers, making the task of maintaining software easier.\n\nWeakness\n * Need specific hardware:\n\nThe Internet Computer’s nodes must be standardized hardware, so not everyone can\nparticipate as a node operator. Especially, it has been reported that the\nstandardized hardware must be distributed under permissions from the Dfinity\nteam, which is not decentralized at all.\n\n * Untested platform:\n\nAlthough claimed to be the new form of the Internet that can host mega-apps the\nsize of Facebook, Reddit, etc.,  there are only a few applications that have\nbeen deployed on the platform. There were LinkedUp - a LinkedIn clone and CanCan\n- a TikTok clone, but both are still more experimental products than actually\nusable applications.\n\n * Bad tokenomic:\n\nThe market capitalization of the ICP - the utility token of the project - is not\nevenly distributed amongst the community. A large amount of ICP (18%) was held\nby team members, making it less secure for investors.\n\n * Low transparency toward the community:\n\nThe Dfinity team has been reported to be unsupportive and intransparent in\nfinancial issues toward the community.\n\nOpportunity\nIntegration with Ethereum: the Internet Computer was not born as an\nEthereum-killer, but each blockchain has its priorities and is meant to support\neach other. While Ethereum focuses on a decentralized system where anyone can\nparticipate without fear of being controlled, the Internet Computer is a little\nmore “governed” network with all the standardized hardware requirements or the\nNNS decision-making mechanism. This downside, however, comes with the advantage\nof faster transactions and easier scalability, aspects that Ethereum is\nstruggling with.\n\nThat’s why the Internet Computer is developed to be a supportive factor for the\nEthereum blockchain. Specifically, the Dfinity team is developing their\ncanisters so that Ethereum’s smart contracts can directly call into Internet\nComputer’s canisters, which will boost the speed of transactions for dApps\nwithout sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThreat\n * Components fail: the project has experienced technical issues since launch.\n * Price crash: the most horrific incident of the Dfinity project that still\n   affects its reputation nowadays is its price crash in May 2021, just right\n   after the project’s IDO, when the ICP token dropped 95% in price in 2 months.\n   Although this might partly result from the global crypto market correction\n   that affects every coin at that time, the main reason is due to the team’s\n   mismanagement in issuing the ICP token. Some even alleged that the whole\n   project was only a scam with many buzzwords and misleading marketing.\n\nThe ICP token’s price crash in May 2021 was a huge scandal in the crypto\ncommunityConclusion\n * Dfinity’s Internet Computer is a massive project that will greatly impact the\n   digital world if it succeeds. However, the project is still in the middle of\n   development, with lots of challenges ahead that would take years to tackle.\n   Moreover, with several past evidence of lacking transparency in financial\n   issues, a not very battle-hardened platform, low cooperation with the\n   community, and especially the recent price crash, people should be extremely\n   discrete before participating in the project.\n\nReferences\n[1] Dfinity homepage and White paper, dfinity.org, [https://dfinity.org/] \naccessed 15th March, 2022.\n\n[2] Dominic Williams, DFINITY in a Nutshell: A Non-Technical Introduction, [\nhttps://medium.com/dfinity/dfinity-in-a-nutshell-a-non-technical-introduction-ec45ec5967c1] \naccessed 15th March, 2022.\n\n[3] Dfinity,A Technical Overview of the Internet Computerhttps\n[//medium.com/dfinity/a-technical-overview-of-the-internet-computer-f57c62abc20f]\n, accessed 15th March, 2022. \n\n[4] Berto Parga Pena, Internet Computer VS Other Top Blockchains: Competing To\nBuild The Future\n[https://www.dfinitycommunity.com/internet-computer-vs-layer-1-blockchains/],\naccessed 15th March, 2022. \n\n[5] Dfinity, The Internet Computer Solves Web3’s Reliance on Web2\n[Techhttps://medium.com/dfinity/the-internet-computer-solves-web3s-reliance-on-web2-tech-70a6b4eea43f]\n, accessed 15th March 15th, 2022.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/DFINITY---THE-NEXT-PLATFORM-FOR-THE-INTERNET.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dcf","created_at":"2022-04-20 10:34:13","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 10:27:45","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-04-20 10:55:20","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e47","uuid":"9e3af7e6-9b9c-4f25-9019-e34f4a4bfac2","title":"Bitcoin Security - Quick look into possible attacks on Bitcoin","slug":"untitled-4","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"Bitcoin is one of the most famous and valuable blockchain networks nowadays.

Beside user-assigned access grants to ensure privacy, access\n   management is provided with flexible and ultra-secure capabilities by Storj’s\n   edge-based security model with delegated authorization.\n * Swarm: “Swarm is a system of peer-to-peer networked nodes that create a\n   decentralized storage and communication service” [https://www.ethswarm.org/].\n   Due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the\n   Ethereum blockchain, the system is economically self-sustaining. Bee, a Swarm\n   client, implemented in Go, is the basic building block for Swarm Network. Bee\n   provides low-level constructs for file storage, feeds, key-value stores, and\n   untraceable communication.\n\nThe similarity of projects\nAll projects use blockchain technology and peer-to-peer network mechanism in\nstoring distributed data. Each technology has a token or coin that represents\nit.\n\nThere are 2 main functions in each project: the provider of data storage space\nand the data owner. The data owner will store the data in the storage space\nleased by the provider. All payments are made in cryptocurrency of decentralized\nstorage technology.\n\nThe data is all broken down, copied, and stored in distributed databases around\nthe world. Stored data will not be affected by agents such as natural disasters,\nhackers, or manipulated by third parties. Users can access their data anytime\nand anywhere, while those who provide data storage space only partially know\nfrom this data.\n\nThe differences between two projects/versions\n\nFilecoin\n\nSia\n\nStorj\n\nSwarm\n\nNetwork\n\nIPFS - IPFS requests specify only the cryptographic hash (like a fingerprint or\nidentifier) of the data instead of requesting data hosted from a specific\nlocationin HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\n\nSia network - Each file is broken into 30 segments by the Sia client software.\nThen, the segments will be distributed to different hosts.\n\nStorj network - like Sia, Storj breaks data into smaller segments, encrypts them\nby using AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption, and stores them across the global\nnetwork.\n\nSwarm network - Like a distributed, content-addressed chunk store which makes\nuse of Ethereum’s dev p2p network layer for peer discovery and communication.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nFilecoin (FIL)\n\nSiacoin\n\nStorjcoin\n\nSwarm BZZ\n\nPrice\n\nAnyone can participate in Filecoin, so any single company does not control\npricing. Although this offers greater flexibility, organizations working within\nspecific storage budgets may be difficult, especially when trying to calculate\n\"gas fees,\" which are charges for resources consumed by messages.\n\nThe storage providers have to compete for business in the decentralized storage\nmarketplace provided by Sia. That is why pricing is less predictable.\n\nUsers offer fixed pricing, so it is easier to budget storage costs.The amount of\ndata the organization stores and downloads will decide the exact price.\n\nSwarm has a close relationship with Ethereum as one of the three pillars of\nEthereum. The price of the swarm is determined by the value of Ethereum.\n\nData Storage\n\nA huge number of storage providers in the Filecoin network can satisfy the\nvarying needs of different customers. Three distinct proof-based mechanisms:\n\nProof of Spacetime, Proof of Replication, Proof of Storagebuilt into the\nFilecoin storage network’s consensus algorithm\n\nData is automatically encrypted, split up into 30 segments, and sent to various\nstorage providers around the world when data is uploaded to Sia. The Providers \nare penalized for missing submitting Proof of Storage\n[https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-consensus-mechanism-types-of-algorithm] \nand compensated for proofing\n\nBy incentivizing users from all over the world to contribute spare storage space\nto companies or users who demand ultra-secure and private storage, Storj takes\nadvantage of latent storage and under-utilized network capacity.\n\nTo ensure the availability of data, Swarm has built-in privacy protection,\ncommunication, and redundancy functions. Once a single node is required, any\ndata and any device can continuously transmit data offline.\n\nBackup\n\nProof-of-replication - In filecoin, every single miner has to prove to the\nnetwork that a unique copy of a data piece is stored entirely.Reed-Solomon\nerasure codingis used by Sia to ensure redundancy and make it possible to\nrecover a file from only 10 of its segments.\n\nA file is broken into 80 segments, so just by any 30 of those segments, a\ncustomer can reconstitute the file.\n\nSwarm provides Bee clients service. Data is saved and backed up from Bee nodes\n\nConclusion\nEach project aims to provide users with a decentralized data storage service.\nThereby, data is protected better from hacker attacks, unaffected by natural\ndisasters, and dominated by centralized data storage providers. Users can not\nonly use the hosting service at a reasonable price but also can rent out the\nexisting storage space to earn extra income. Decentralized storage projects\ntowards an open community, where anyone can share and exchange data storage in a\nsecure, resource-optimized way.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Storj Docs

Because my health factor only got below 1 when the\nvalue of my collateral 1000 DAI drops to (if my debt value stays the same):\n\nor my debt value goes up to (if my collateral value stays the same):\n\nBut this can’t ever happen since both my debt and my collateral are stablecoin\nwhose values remain the same.\n\nIn the second example, since I only borrow stablecoin, I’m only get liquidated\nwhen my collateral value drops to:\n\nBecause in my collateral, the only asset that change is LINK (DAI is\nstablecoin).\n\nSo the LINK value that I have has to drop to:\n\nSo I only got liquidated only when the LINK value dropped 64.54%. I think it’s\nreally hard to happen over one night.\n\nThrough this writing, I hope you now understand the state of your assets and can\ncontrol them wisely.\n\nReference: \n[1] Risk Parameters, Aave document [\nhttps://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters], assessed 18th April\n2022. \n\n[2] Testing Aave Protocol V2 and V3, Aave document\n[https://docs.aave.com/faq/testing-aave], accessed 18th April 2022.\n\n[3] Aave Protocol Whitepaperv1, Avve document\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aave-protocol/master/docs/Aave_Protocol_Whitepaper_v1_0.pdf]\n, accessed 18th April 2022.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/Aave-Lending-V2--Part-1-.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dce","created_at":"2022-04-22 10:19:58","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 10:31:56","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-04-22 10:40:44","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e4a","uuid":"e24fe98e-9f9a-4994-b51e-b26375173ca3","title":"Introduction to Aave Lending V2 (Part 2)","slug":"introduction-to-aave-lending-v2-part-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yjetRcVIBcfBbiCYbfNilfCRsNu-9v9qGFIFJgwjO1sF_yrjF3riEz0QrcEEAouGl72HPmwJnYeEbxY55Gn2-EFKwO5iZgzaiKFP2pvmOq_ER2FBWu49sUcjQnLMCySgq5-JPsJT\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Link full size: <a href=\\\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K3OXWpI0Y_FYEG3mVScUQZc4RM8ukeBb/view?usp=sharing\\\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K3OXWpI0Y_FYEG3mVScUQZc4RM8ukeBb/view?usp=sharing</a>\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/proxy_delegate.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aave-protocol/master/docs/Aave_Protocol_Whitepaper_v1_0.pdf\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"The Aave protocol contains a large number of smart contracts and governance roles that work together to provide the protocol's services. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"In this second part of my series, I will focus on the major contracts and how they interact with one another to keep things simple.\"]]],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[1],1,\"Smart contracts\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Here is a diagram that shows the different contracts and how they interact with one other in the protocol.\"],[1,[],0,0]]],[10,0],[1,\"h2\",[[0,[1],1,\"Lending Pool Addresses Provider Registry\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"As you can see from the diagram above, LendingPoolAddressesProviderRegistry contains many LendingPoolAddressProvider.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"LendingPoolAddressesProviderRegistry is a register of the active LendingPoolAddressProvider contracts, covering all markets.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Each LendingPoolAddressesProvider has an id.

You need to\napprove delegation to the WETH Gateway in order to borrow ETH from the pool.\n\nReference: \n[1] Introduction, Aave document [https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/],\naccessed 19th March 2022. \n\n[2] Aave whitepaper, Aave document\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aave-protocol/master/docs/Aave_Protocol_Whitepaper_v1_0.pdf]\n, accessed 19th March.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/Aave-Lending-V-2--Part-2-.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dce","created_at":"2022-04-22 10:41:18","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 10:32:27","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-04-22 10:59:59","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e4b","uuid":"bd5416b7-951f-4e53-b797-ffa5c6d87c8e","title":"A Comparison between Uniswap and PancakeSwap","slug":"a-comparison-betweenuniswap-and-pancakeswap","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/W0Wf5kISgXdTzaG-_pxEzbgn-p2N7axmSSokzpu0z3TtdGcgUdSRP2y5foIi3qCur2Qh7vXA0kFWL4GTvm1wLedmITxF9v2zJc4XdQYC_ccRinN7_O743jRjXC8aB_5gMB60mE6Z\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Source: PancakeSwap website\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\" https://askanydifference.com/difference-between-pancakeswap-and-uniswap\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/roadmap\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"In the crypto community explosion era, many platforms were introduced to support decentralized exchange, among which are Uniswap and PancakeSwap.

But what is Prover Technology exactly? Prover Technology is\na formal verification technique (formal verification is the process of proving\nor disproving the correctness of specified algorithms underpinning a system\nconcerning a formal specification or property using formal mathematics methods).\nFormal verification has been a useful way to ensure the security of traditional\nsoftware programs, so it is a promising technique to protect smart contracts.\n\n[Purpose 3] Making it easier to use Certora Prover\nLast but not least, like every other instruction, we want to help readers use\nCertora Prover. Although Certora Prover’s guide is already pretty specific, we\nstill want to ensure that no one will be confused using Certora Prover. \n\nInstructions\n\n[Step 1] Install Certora Prover\nFollow installation steps in Installation of Certora Prover - Certora Prover\nDocumentation - Confluence (atlassian.net)\n[https://certora.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPD/pages/7274497/Installation+of+Certora+Prover]\n.\n\n[Step 2] Writing the specification\nWrite specific rules that you want your smart contract to follow. You can learn\nhow to write a specification in Specification By Example - Certora Prover\nDocumentation - Confluence (atlassian.net)\n[https://certora.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPD/pages/5243036/Specification+By+Example]\n.\n\nLet’s say that you have a smart contract which is called Bank.sol as follow:\n\npragma solidity ^0.7.0;\n \ncontract BankBroken {\n    // mapping from a user to its balance\n    mapping (address => uint256) private funds;\n    // total funds in the bank\n    uint256  totalFunds;\n \n    // deposit amount into bank and update the user's balance in the bank accordingly\n    function deposit(uint256 amount) public payable {\n        funds[msg.sender] += amount;\n        totalFunds += amount;\n    }\n    \n    // \n    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {\n        require(funds[msg.sender] > amount);\n        uint256 fundsTo = funds[to];\n        funds[msg.sender] -= amount;\n        funds[to] = fundsTo + amount;       \n    }\n \n    // withdraw the total balance of user into its personal wallet address\n    function withdraw() public returns (bool success)  {\n        uint256 amount = getFunds(msg.sender);\n        funds[msg.sender] = 0;\n        success = msg.sender.send(amount);\n        totalFunds -=amount;\n    }\n    \n    // retrieves the user's recorded balance in the bank\n    function getFunds(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\n        return funds[account];\n    }\n    \n    // retrieves the total funds that the bank stores\n    function getTotalFunds() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return totalFunds;\n    }\n    \n    // retrieves the account's ETH balance in its personal wallet address\n    function getEthBalance(address account) public view returns (uint256){\n        return account.balance;\n    }\n}\n\n\n*Source code is taken from Certora Online Editor [https://demo.certora.com/]\n\nAnd here is a rule for verifying that withdrawal either revert or returns true.\n\nrule withdraw_succeeds {\n  /* The env type represents the EVM parameters passed in every\n  call (msg.*, tx.*, block.* variables in solidity   */\n  env e;\n  // Invoke function withdraw and assume it does not revert\n  /* For non-envfree methods, the environment is passed as the first argument*/\n  bool success = withdraw(e);\n  assert success, \"withdraw must succeed\";\n}\n\n\nThe rule calls to withdraw with an arbitrary EVM environment (e) in an arbitrary\ninitial state. It assumes that the function does not revert. The assert command\nchecks that success is true on all potential executions. Notice that each\nSolidity function has an extra argument, which is the EVM environment.\n\nTo simulate the execution of all functions in the contract, you can define a\nmethod argument in the rule and use it in invocation statements. For example:\n\nrule others_can_only_increase_my_balance() {\n  method f; // an arbitrary function in the contract\n  env e;  // the execution environment\n  address other;\n  // Assume the actor and the other address are distinct\n  require e.msg.sender != other;\n  // Get the balance of `other` before the invocation\n  uint256 _balance = getFunds(other);\n  calldataarg arg; // any argument\n  f(e, arg); // successful (potentially state-changing!)\n  // Get the balance of `other` after the invocation\n  uint256 balance_ = getFunds(other);\n  assert _balance <= balance_, \"Reduced the balance of another address\";\n}\n\n\nThe Prover verifies that the conditions hold against any function call with any\narguments.\n\n[Step 3] Start a verification\nWhen starting the verification, you will be prompted to set the configurations,\nsuch as the main contract name, solidity compiler version, etc. These\nconfigurations will be stored in a local configuration file in the conf \nsubfolder. You can edit the configuration file manually or create a new one\n(clicking on the Create Certora IDE conf file button).\n\n\nSource: Certora IDE Extension in VS CodeThe conf file will be used to start the verification process. Next, use the VS\nCode Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) to trigger the Certora Run Script\ncommand or simply click the Run Certora IDE button.\n\nAlternatively, you can follow the instructions in Running The Certora Prover -\nCertora Prover Documentation - Confluence (atlassian.net)\n[https://certora.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPD/pages/284360712/Running+The+Certora+Prover]\n.\n\n[Step 4] Results\nAfter approving the request using the specified access key, the program submits\nthe work to Certora's server. The command line will get messages alerting it of\nits progress. It's worth noting that the job will continue to run even if you\ninterrupt it. An email message is issued with links to the findings when the\nverification is complete.\n\nThe output will additionally include links to the results in case the CLI tool\nis not interrupted:\n\nStatus page:\nhttps://prover.certora.com/jobStatus/...?anonymousKey={anonymousKey}\n\nVerification report:\nhttps://prover.certora.com/output/...?anonymousKey={anonymousKey}\n\nFull report:\nhttps://prover.certora.com/zipOutput/...?anonymousKey={anonymousKey}\n\nFollow these links to view the results.\n\nThe results might look like this:\n\nA verification report is an HTML file that displays all the spec file rules in a\ntable. A green hue is assigned to each officially proven rule. Rules that have\nbeen broken are shown in red. The call trace and arguments that led to the\nviolation will also be included in the report. The Certora Prover discovers a\nviolation of the monotone rule in this case. To examine the call trace and try\nto figure out the reason, click the rule.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Certora website [https://www.certora.com/], accessed 19th March 2022. \n\n[2] Certora Prover Documentation, atlassian.net\n[https://certora.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPD/overview], accessed 19th March\n2022. \n\n[3] Installation of Certora Prover, Certora Prover Documentation, atlassian.net\n[https://certora.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPD/pages/7274497/Installation+of+Certora+Prover]\n, accessed 19th March 2022. \n\n[4] Specification By Example, Certora Prover Documentation, atlassian.net\n[https://certora.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPD/pages/5243036/Specification+By+Example]\n, accessed 19th March 2022. \n\n[5] W.

After that, a reward is sent to the user in the function\nwithdrawRewardFor(), but the attacker's balance has not been set to zero until\nthat function is called complete. \n\nfunction withdrawRewardFor(address _account) noEther internal returns (bool _success) {\n        if ((balanceOf(_account) * rewardAccount.accumulatedInput()) / totalSupply < paidOut[_account])\n            throw;\n \n        uint reward =\n            (balanceOf(_account) * rewardAccount.accumulatedInput()) / totalSupply - paidOut[_account];\n \n        reward = rewardAccount.balance < reward ? rewardAccount.balance : reward;\n \n       \n        if (!rewardAccount.payOut(_account, reward))\n            throw;\n        paidOut[_account] += reward;\n        return true;\n}\n\n\n\nVariable paidOut is updated after function payOut is called:\nfunction payOut(address _recipient, uint _amount) returns (bool) {\n        if (msg.sender != owner || msg.value > 0 || (payOwnerOnly && _recipient != owner))\n            throw;\n        if (_recipient.call.value(_amount)()) {\n            PayOut(_recipient, _amount);\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            return false;\n        }\n}\n\n\nBecause both user’s balance and variable paidOut is not updated, so the second\ncall to function withdrawRewardFor() can be called successfully. Thus, hackers\nneed to trigger a fallback function to call function splitDAO() again with the\nsame parameters after receiving funds from function withdrawRewardFor().\n\nA simply schema to attack The DAO:\n\n 1. Propose a split by function createProposal() in DAO.sol and wait for the\n    voting period to end.\n 2. Call function splitDAO() in DAO.sol\n 3. Receive funds from The DAO by your new DAO.\n 4. While you receive the reward from function withdrawRewardFor(), trigger\n    fallback function to call function splitDAO again with the same parameters.\n 5. The DAO will send you funds and rewards before updating your balance, so you\n    can repeat step 4 to drain all funds from The DAO.\n\nHow to fix this error?\nOn 12 Jun, before the attack, a minor update was committed to branch development\nin GitHub. It updated the variable paidOut before the function payOut() was\ncalled. But this modification is not enough to protect The DAO against the\nattack.\n\nWith this update, in the second function call, the variable reward will have a\nvalue of 0. But the function payOut() still transfers 0 ETH to the user, and the\nfallback function is still triggered.\n\nVulnerabilities in The DAO appear throughout the function splitDAO() and the\nrelated functions. To fix this error, the structure of the function splitDAO()\nwill have to be fixed quite a lot which is pretty complex. I think at least the\nuser’s balance should be updated before funds are transferred to the child DAO.\n\n// Move ether and assign new Tokens\n        uint fundsToBeMoved =\n            (balances[msg.sender] * p.splitData[0].splitBalance) /\n            p.splitData[0].totalSupply;\n        balances[msg.sender] = 0; // UPDATE USER'S BALANCE Before SEND FUNDS\n        paidOut[msg.sender] = 0;\n        if (p.splitData[0].newDAO.createTokenProxy.value(fundsToBeMoved)(msg.sender) == false)\n            throw;\n\n\nConclusion\nAfter this attack, The DAO Community was in discussion to provide solutions to\novercome the consequence of the attack. In this post, I didn’t go into the\nsolution of The DAO but I hope this post will help you to avoid this mistake in\nthe future.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/Lines-of-code-worth-60-million-dollars-in-The-DAO.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dd2","created_at":"2022-04-25 10:58:55","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 10:57:46","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-04-25 11:10:56","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e4e","uuid":"f42f4c7e-0c7b-4f6c-9a70-0f67f9ded29d","title":"ERC-4626: DeFi’s Newest Money Lego","slug":"erc-4626-defis-newest-money-lego","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Yg96Zq9Rd1YcnhX7p3pVaW2bHSG-8iBhXD0kUL4S9WRzBSqdiVNk1X4dNn1-EwjBQDPkFkkQtnL9IFk_gFNnwpyfIGTBo8aDrGgPPiaxt2wM8J4G1QPKpeGsjrEs_-fabinK0FXK\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"<a href=\\\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20\\\"><em>Tokenized Vault Standard</em></a>\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2tzb7AIKZgk2IkO_o5fHFPcQF_AlFghuddFKpm9Xp-hDbWoQv-jwdnZLn-FEBpakxjS1FAv7KaK7HgHVASLBbxWh5dcRND69HF9SnyIbbAlu1whZB6UEvl2lsZjjpyFCm2BU0mTa\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"<em>“ERC4626 standardizes this paradigm of depositing and withdrawing from a vault denominated in a single token”- Joey Santoro talks about ERC-4626 on his Twitter.

At the most basic\nlevel, each 'block' is a database component that stores data. There are two\nsorts of blockchain: public and private. While public blockchains are\ndecentralized peer-to-peer networks, the ledger in private blockchains is\ngoverned by a centralized authority: The major distinction is the level of\naccess provided to users.\n\nPublic blockchain network\nPublic blockchains, also known as permissionless blockchains, are entirely open\nand adhere to the concept of decentralization to the letter. That is, anyone can\njoin the network and read, write, or participate within the blockchain. A public\nblockchain is also decentralized. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are public\nblockchains. Those are the two most successful, best examples of public\nblockchain networks to date. Anyone in the network has access to the chain and\ncan add blocks to it. Public blockchains are also essentially anonymous, in\ncontrast to private blockchains, which do not conceal the identities of anyone\nparticipating in the transaction.\n\nFigure 1: Example of the public blockchain network. Source: idautu.comThe\nfollowing characteristics of public blockchain:\n\n * High Security — It is safe because of mining (51 percent rule).\n * Open Environment — The public blockchain is accessible to everybody.\n * Anonymous Nature — Everyone in the public blockchain is anonymous. There is\n   no need to use your real name or identity, so everything remains concealed,\n   and no one can trace you down based on that.\n * No Regulations — There are no rules that nodes must obey on the public\n   blockchain. As a result, there is no limit to how this platform may be used\n   to improve one's life.\n * Full Transparency — A public blockchain allows you to view the ledger at any\n   moment. There is no room for corruption or inconsistencies, and everyone is\n   required to keep the ledger and participate in consensus.\n * True Decentralization — There is no centralized entity in this form of\n   blockchain. As a result, the burden for network maintenance falls entirely on\n   the nodes. They are updating the ledger, which promotes justice with the use\n   of a consensus method.\n * Full User Empowerment — In most networks, users are required to obey a slew\n   of rules and regulations. In many circumstances, the regulations may not even\n   be just. However, this is not the case with public blockchain networks.\n * Immutable — Once something is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be\n   altered.\n * Distributed — Unlike a client-server method, the database is not centralized,\n   and all nodes in the blockchain participate in transaction validation.\n\nPrivate blockchain network\nA private blockchain is administered by a network administrator, and members\nmust get permission to join the network, making it a permissioned blockchain.\nThe network is controlled by one or many companies, necessitating reliance on\nthird-party transactions. Only the entity participating in the transaction has\nknowledge of the transaction completed in this sort of blockchain, and others\nwill not be able to access it, i.e., transactions are private.\n\nFigure 2: Example of the private blockchain network. Source: Cevgroup.orgSome of\nthe benefits of private blockchain include:\n\n * Complete Privacy - It focuses on privacy issues.\n * Private Blockchains have a higher degree of centralized control.\n * High Efficiency and Faster Transactions — When nodes are distributed locally,\n   yet fewer nodes are participating in the ledger, performance improves.\n * Better Scalability - The flexibility to add nodes and services on demand may\n   greatly benefit the organization.\n\nThe similarity between a private blockchain and public blockchain\nThe similarities between public and private blockchains are that they both act\nas append-only ledgers where data may be added but not changed or removed. As a\nresult, these are known as immutable records. Because both of these blockchains\nare decentralized and dispersed throughout a peer-to-peer network of computers,\neach network node possesses a complete duplicate of the ledger.\n\nBoth verify the authenticity of a record, offering a significant amount of\nimmutability until the majority of participants agree that it is a legitimate\nrecord and establish an agreement. This reduces the possibility of tampering\nwith the records.\n\nBoth blockchains rely on a large number of users from any third party to\nauthenticate updates to the distributed ledger, resulting in the construction of\na new master copy that can be viewed by everyone at all times.\n\nDifference between public blockchain and private blockchain\n\nPublic blockchain\n\nPrivate blockchain\n\nAccess\n\nAnyone may read, write, and participate in this form of blockchain. As a result,\nit is a permissionless blockchain. It is open to the public.\n\nThis blockchain allows for access to reading and writing only via invitation,\nindicating that it is a permissioned blockchain.\n\nNetwork Actors\n\nThey don't know each other.\n\nThey know each other\n\nOrder Of Magnitude\n\nA public blockchain has a lower order of magnitude than a private blockchain\nsince it is lighter and enables transactional throughput.\n\nThe order of magnitude is greater.\n\nNative Token\n\nYes\n\nNot necessary\n\nSpeed\n\nSlow\n\nFast\n\nDecentralized Vs. Centralized\n\nis decentralized.\n\nis more centralized.\n\nTransactions per second\n\nlesser\n\nmore\n\nSecurity\n\nBecause of decentralization and active engagement, a public network is more\nsecure. Because of the greater number of nodes in the network, it is practically\ndifficult for 'bad actors' to assault the system and take control of the\nconsensus network.\n\nA private blockchain is more vulnerable to attacks, dangers, and data\nbreaches/misuse. It is simple for rogue actors to jeopardize the whole network.\nAs a result, it is less secure.\n\nEnergy Consumption\n\nA public blockchain uses more energy than a private blockchain since it takes a\nlarge number of electrical resources to run and establish network agreements.\n\nPrivate blockchains to use far less electricity and power.\n\nConsensus algorithms\n\nSome are proof of work, proof of stake, proof of burn, proof of space, etc.\n\nProof of Elapsed Time (PoET), Raft, and Istanbul BFT can be used only in the\ncase of private blockchains.\n\nAttacks\n\nNo one knows who each validator is on a public blockchain, which raises the\npossibility of a collision or a 51 percent assault (a group of miners that\ncontrol more than 50% of the network's computer power).\n\nMinor collisions are not possible with a private blockchain. Each validator is\nrecognized and has the necessary credentials to be a part of the network.\n\nEffects\n\nDisintermediation has the potential to disrupt present corporate paradigms.\nInfrastructure costs are cheaper. There is no need to drastically maintain\nservers or system administrators. As a result, the cost of developing and\nrunning decentralized applications is reduced (dApps).\n\nReduces transaction costs and data redundancy, as well as replacing old systems,\nstreamlining document processing, and eliminating semi-manual compliance\nmethods.\n\nThe biggest difference between public and private blockchain networks is that\nprivate blockchain networks have to spend investment costs to design, create and\nmanage. On the other hand, a public blockchain network won't have to spend any\nadditional initialization and design fees.\n\nConclusions\nFinally, keep in mind that as public blockchain security measures improve, their\nvalue will rise, making the usage of private blockchain less necessary. Private\nblockchains, on the other hand, can't be beaten when it comes to having more\ncontrol and the capacity to restrict access to certain persons. Each type of\nblockchain has its own strengths. Depending on the business requirements, you\nneed to choose the best one for you.\n\nReference\nDifference between Public and Private blockchain, geeksforgeeks.org\n[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-public-and-private-blockchain/]\n, accessed 12th March 2022. \n\nDifference between private and public blockchain, blog.ipleaders.in\n[https://blog.ipleaders.in/difference-between-private-and-public-blockchain/ ],\naccessed 12th March 2022.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/Private-blockchain-vs-Public-blockchain.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","author_id":"627bbe05943a3633c3eb5dda","created_at":"2022-04-27 11:16:30","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2022-04-27 11:29:25","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2022-04-27 11:29:25","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"627bbe0b943a3633c3eb5e50","uuid":"ffa1e633-9861-4d2b-a5ca-3e75eef0f7e8","title":"What is Ethereum Virtual Machine and How it works","slug":"what-is-ethereum-virtual-machineand-how-it-works","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RZ2pW0EHghtZlzSiCILHLrZZg_nA-rFNGBWmSdczNC9R2wGBOatNyGnzf-VPHccXTnxCZ1VJWBCpW67v9plm882GiNZGmGVcSzpTON9CPm5WrFsvDYKukRmVlrimzrquAD3yTNX7\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Source: <em>https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf</em>\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Vb1Alel4Tfet3vQISp2DtJBviNDk1PHN0eRMQDu78W9pdma3CmiXsUoQxgUei9qtQZ66Rq6bqiTiZdj8ImYZsvwVTDhnRiv6eia5wunu4gJU4P2eAvOaMv2o4o9GW_lcPngc5aQ8\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m9KlZTS-R_whmViQMnGqIhRQYKmc5ilK0HBF2mi6L2mEUx-4oyM6SWC_aqVmP2MDlvQZiU_DMctVKu63mx3knc59y0t8YBQePvH0D_0IBm0N8PdYUgCFdSzL4lk65P0euRUXTW4K\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"Source: <em>https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf</em>\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"$ npm install -g solc\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"// EVMExample.sol\\npragma solidity ^0.8.3;\\ncontract EVMExample {\\nuint256 number = 9;\\n}\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"$ solcjs -o bytescode --bin ./EVMExample.sol\\n// bytescode/EVM_sol_EVMExample.bin\\n60806040526009600055348015601457600080fd5b50603f8060226000396000f3fe6080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212201fdff2ede0793f052591ede6217c413130c4545276017d660c5c9b1c6642343e64736f6c634300080d0033\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lZE_teHyCIvxdLvnio0-lOg8JqcckurZw2Zkdg8hVDAqN1W07i7q3ctVENbw7XiQZu4ANSljg5CsC01e2Gm_mqPZjO1Q5OeafNbeilVbtHiqDp3tHWC45gnQlNTwdoHp-w5bkESK\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4sFtLZS5kqNsx3P1wmIiCMeTW5aORdKkR3NDx0kKCksrxL3iqH92uMEifou_PATK1GE5k_zfThY3CIThm0a5k65wHir-KVCoeyf53jFLuKr7RsJvhiVcj9VE68t47-VnYBE8UO-u\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"0xa1 0x65 ‘b’ ‘z’ ‘z’ ‘r’ ‘0’ 0x58 0x22 [32 bytes swarm hash] 0x00 0x33\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"12201fdff2ede0793f052591ede6217c413130c4545276017d660c5c9b1c6642343e64736f6c634300080d\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"In this article, we will learn about EVM, short for Ethereum Virtual Machine, about which you must have heard if you’ve ever developed a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain network.

Virtual machines are the level of abstraction\nbetween the executing code and the executing machine. This layer is needed to\nenhance software portability and ensure applications are segregated from each\nother and their underlying layers.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nSome basic familiarity with common terminologies in computer science, such as \nbytes[1], memory[2], and a stack[3], are necessary to understand the EVM.\n\nIt will also be helpful if you have a basic knowledge of the blockchain[4] and \nthe Ethereum network[5]. \n\nWhat is Ethereum Virtual Machine\nThe term “Distributed ledger” is often used to describe blockchain like Bitcoin,\nwhich enables a decentralized currency using fundamental tools of cryptography.\nWhile Ethereum has its own native cryptocurrency (Ether) that follows almost\nexactly the same intuitive rules, it also enables a much more powerful “Ethereum\nVirtual Machine.” This state machine can execute arbitrary machine code.\n\nEthereum Virtual Machine architecture\nThe EVM is a Turing-complete state machine because all execution steps are\nlimited to a finite number of computational steps. This is different from\nBitcoin when on Bitcoin, the Stack machine is just a Turing-incomplete machine.\n\n\nSource: https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdfThe\ncode in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode\nlanguage. The code consists of a series of bytes, where each byte represents an\noperation. The operations have access to three types of space in which to store\ndata:\n\n * The Stack is a last-in-first-out container to which values can be pushed and\n   popped\n * Memory is an infinitely expandable byte array but is short-term memory\n * The contract's long-term storage, a key/value store. Unlike stack and memory,\n   which reset after computation ends, storage persists for the long term.\n\nOpcode\nSmart contract languages like Solidity cannot be executed by the EVM directly.\nInstead, they are compiled into low-level machine instructions. Under the hood,\nthe EVM uses opcodes - a set of instructions to execute specific tasks. Until\nthe present time, there are 140 unique opcodes. Together, these opcodes allow\nthe EVM to be Turing-complete. This means the EVM is able to compute anything.\nWe can split all opcodes into the following categories:\n\n * Stack-manipulating opcodes: PUSH, POP, DUP, SWAP\n * Arithmetic/comparison/bitwise opcodes: ADD, SUB, GT, LT, AND, OR\n * Environmental opcodes: CALLER, CALLVALUE, NUMBER\n * Memory-manipulating opcodes: MLOAD, MSTORE, MSTORE8, MSIZE\n * Storage-manipulating opcodes: SLOAD, SSTORE\n * Program counter related opcodes: JUMP, JUMPI, PC, JUMPDEST\n * Halting opcodes: STOP, RETURN, REVERT, INVALID, SELFDESTRUCT\n\nHow EVM work\nEVM execution\nThe formal execution model of EVM code is very simple. While the Ethereum\nvirtual machine is running, its full computational state can be defined by the\ntuple (block_state, transaction, message, code, memory, stack, pc, gas), where\nblock_state is the global state containing all accounts and includes balances\nand storage. At the start of every round of execution, the current instruction\nis found by taking the pcth byte of code (or 0 if pc >= len(code)), and each\ninstruction has its own definition in terms of how it affects the tuple.\nAlthough there are many ways to optimize Ethereum virtual machine execution via\njust-in-time compilation, a basic implementation of Ethereum can be done in a\nfew hundred lines of code.\n\n\n\nSource: https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf\nCompile Solidity to EVM Bytecode\n\nIn this section, we will go into detail about how the Solidity script is\ncompiled to bytecode. First of all, we need to install the Solidity compiler.\n\n$ npm install -g solc\n\nThen, we have a simple smart contract script written by Solidity\n\n// EVMExample.sol\npragma solidity ^0.8.3;\ncontract EVMExample {\nuint256 number = 9;\n}\n\nEVMExample contract is a simple smart contract, which declares an uint256\nvariable with a value equal to 9.  We will compile the above smart contract by\nexecuting the command:\n\n$ solcjs -o bytescode --bin ./EVMExample.sol\n// bytescode/EVM_sol_EVMExample.bin\n60806040526009600055348015601457600080fd5b50603f8060226000396000f3fe6080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212201fdff2ede0793f052591ede6217c413130c4545276017d660c5c9b1c6642343e64736f6c634300080d0033\n\nWe can split the result bytecode into three parts:\n\n1. Constructor \n60806040526009600055348015601457600080fd5b50603f8060226000396000f3fe\n\n\n2. Runtime\n\n6080604052600080fdfe\n\n3. Metadata \na26469706673582212201fdff2ede0793f052591ede6217c413130c4545276017d660c5c9b1c6642343e64736f6c634300080d0033\n\nAt the end of this byte code is a Swarm hash of a metadata file created by\nSolidity. Swarm is decentralized file storage. Although the Swarm hash will also\nbe included in the runtime bytecode, it will never be interpreted as opcodes by\nthe EVM because its location can never be reached. Currently, Solidity utilizes\nthe following format:\n\n0xa1 0x65 ‘b’ ‘z’ ‘z’ ‘r’ ‘0’ 0x58 0x22 [32 bytes swarm hash] 0x00 0x33\n\nIn this case, the Swarm hash is:\n\n12201fdff2ede0793f052591ede6217c413130c4545276017d660c5c9b1c6642343e64736f6c634300080d\n\nThe metadata file contains information about the contract, such as: the compiler\nversion, the contract’s functions\n\nConclusion\nEthereum provides a decentralized ecosystem for developers to deploy, execute\nthe smart contract on EVM, and build the decentralized applications on it.\nAlthough executing the smart contract on EVM might be a lot more expensive than\nrunning programs on traditional servers, The outstanding advantage of EVM is\nundeniable.\n\nIf reading this article made you interested in learning more about developing\nsmart contracts or blockchain knowledge, please subscribe to us to receive\nnotifications of the latest posts.
